    <h1>Extensions and AddOns</h1>
    <div class="toc"> </div>
    <p>You can extend the functionality in different ways. Some extensions are
      already installed together with AvNav or are available as seperate
      packages.</p>
    <h2>Adding Other Web Pages</h2>
    <p>== not on Android ==</p>
    <p>You can add other web pages (either externally or on the same server like
      AvNav) as so called "User Apps".<br>
      There is a dialog based configuration available at the <a href="../userdoc/addonconfigpage.html">User
        App Config Page</a>. The Pages will become visible at the <a href="../userdoc/addonpage.html">User
        App Page</a>.</p>
    <h2>Extending the Functionality of the Web App</h2>
    <p>With some lines of java script code you can add functionality to the web
      app. Especially you can define own display (text based or graphics based),
      you can add new formatters for display values - or even add buttons that
      will trigger various actions.<br>
      Your java script code will go to a <a href="userjs.html">user.js</a> file
      and AvNav provides an integrated editor for this file on the <a href="../userdoc/downloadpage.html">Files/Download</a>
      page.<br>
      Beside the java script code you typically will also need some css code to
      tune the display of your new entities - this css will go into a <a href="usercss.html">user.css</a>
      file.</p>
    <h2>Plugins</h2>
    <p>== not on Android ==</p>
    <p>Plugins allow to extend the functionality of AvNav both on the server
      side and in the display (client). AvNav already provides some built in
      plugins, others can be installed as packages. And you can develop your
      own.</p>
    <p>Plugins provided with AvNav:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>SignalK<br>
        Connect to a SignalK Server. See the <a href="CanboatAndSignalk.html#SignalK">detailed
          description</a>.</li>
      <li>Canboat<br>
        This implements NMEA2000 support using canboat. See the <a href="CanboatAndSignalk.html#Canboat">detailed
          description</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    For the development of own plugins and a list of plugins that you can
    install as packages refer to the <a href="plugins.html">plugin description</a>.<br>
