    <h1>Converting Tracks to Routes</h1>
    <div class="toc"> </div>
    <p>AvNav is permanently recording <a href="../quickstart.html#tracks">tracks</a>.
      For every day a new track file (gpx) is written.</p>
    <p>Those tracks (or tracks that have been uploaded at the <a href="../userdoc/downloadpage.html">Files/Download</a>
      page) can be converted to routes to use them in navigation.</p>
    <h2>Concept</h2>
    <p>For this conversion you typically need to reduce the number of points in
      the track as they often have more then 1000 points. Otherwise use such a
      route is nearly impossible.</p>
    <p>AvNav is using an algorithm that is taken from <a href="https://www.gpsbabel.org/htmldoc-development/filter_simplify.html">GPS
        Babel</a>. One after the other the points will be removed that have the
      least significant distance from the line between the two neighboring
      points.</p>
    <p>You can provide a parameter to define the maximum tolerable distance. The
      larger distance you allow the fewer points the created route will contain.
      You should try to keep your routes below 50 points to make them nicely
      usable.</p>
    <p>After the conversion you can fine tune the route in the <a href="../userdoc/editroutepage.html">Route-Editor</a>.</p>
    <h2>Handling</h2>
    <p>You can reach the conversion dialog either from the Files/Download page
      from within the <a href="../userdoc/downloadpage.html#tracks">Track Info
        Dialog</a> (<img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/route.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">Convert
      Button) or from the info dialog if you have the track selected as an <a href="overlays.html#usage">Overlay</a>
      on the chart and click on a point within it. Again you have the&nbsp; <img
        src="../viewerimages/icons-new/route.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">Convert
      Button - see picture.</p>
    <img src="FeatureInfo-Track.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>After clicking "Convert" you will get the donversion dialog.</p>
    <img src="TracksToRoutes1.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>Normally (as in the picture) you will get a warning about your point
      caount being above 50.</p>
    <p>Using "max Xte" you conmfigure the converter and start the conversion
      using "Compute". If the number of points still does not fit you can tray
      again with a changed xte.</p>
    <img src="TracksToRoutes2.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>In the example a xte of 22m gave me a good route.</p>
    <p>Within the dialog you can still change the name for the new route (and
      decide to potentially overwrite an existing one with the same name).</p>
    <p>After saving you can directly start editing the route.</p>
    <img src="TracksToRoutes3.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>At this point it counts if you had the track as an overlay at the chart
      as you can now easily check if all important points from the track are
      available in the route.</p>
