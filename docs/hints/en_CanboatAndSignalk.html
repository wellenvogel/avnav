    <h1>Interworking with Canboat and SignalK</h1>
    <p>Starting with release 20200204 AvNav can interact with canboat (NMEA2000)
      and signalk.</p>
    <p>Important Hint: Since version 20220421 the handling for <a href="#SignalK">SignalK</a>
      changed.</p>

    <h2><a name="Canboat" id="Canboat"></a>Canboat (NMEA2000)</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/canboat/canboat">Canboat</a> supports
      interfacing to NMEA 2000 bus systems using either a CAN adapter (e.g. <a
        href="https://www.reichelt.de/entwicklerboards-can-modul-mcp2515-mcp2562-debo-can-modul-p239277.html">MCP2515</a>
      or a <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RS485_CAN_HAT">Waveshare
        RS485 CAN-HAT</a> ) or USB attached devices like the Actisene NGT-1. For
      simple adapters you need to ensure that they have 2 voltage supplies (3.3V
      and 5V) to be usable for the raspberry pi. Many of the simple ones do not
      have that!</p>
    <img title="Canboat" alt="" src="Canboat.png" width="800">
    <p>In the diagram the basic setup is shown as we provide it with the <a href="../install.html#Headless">headless
        images</a>. </p>
    <p>If you connect a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=141052">CAN
        adapter</a> via <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/spi/README.md">SPI</a>
      typically you need to enable an overlay in /boot/config.txt. Appropriate
      entries are prepared to use the MCP2515 and only need to be uncommented.
      Potentially you have to adjust the clock frequency and the GPIO pin used
      for the interrupt. Such can adapters are listed as network interface
      (probably they require configuration, but they are preconfigured in the
      images).<br>
      The interface should be visible with</p>
    <div class="code">ifconfig can0</div>
    <p>If you are planning to use an Actisense NGT-1 connected via USB refer to
      the <a href="https://github.com/canboat/canboat/wiki/actisense-serial">documentation
        at canboat</a>.</p>
    <p>AvNav is communicating with <a href="https://github.com/canboat/canboat/wiki/n2kd">n2kd</a>.
      This daemon converts incoming NMEA2000 data to NMEA0183 (although not
      completely). The configuration for n2kd is located at</p>
    <div class="code">/etc/default/n2kd</div>
    <p>Within our images this file predefines a connection to can0. If you are
      going to use an USB based adapter you have to modify this configuration.<br>
      In this case, please also add an entry in avnav_server.xml to exclude this
      adapter from auto detection (watch the AvNav status page while connecting
      the adapter - note its USB id and use it for the entry):</p>
    <div class="code">&lt;AVNUsbSerialReader .....&gt;<br>&lt;UsbDevice usbid="x:y.z" type="ignore"/&gt; <br>....</div>
    <p>When traffic is present on the NMEA 2000 bus and if everything is setup
      correctly, you should see NMEA data / json data at ports 2599 and 2598.
      You can check this with</p>
    <div class="code">nc localhost 2599</div>
    <p>If you are unable to see data you can check the canboat status with</p>
    <div class="code">sudo systemctl status canboat</div>
    <p>There should be 2 connections between AvNav and n2kd (predefined in the
      images). AvNav receives NMEA0183 data on one connection (port 2599) and
      some of the json data on the other connection (port 2598). The latter is
      necessary as n2kd does not provide any NMEA0183 record containing a
      complete time stamp (like RMC). To get the data from NMEA2000 AvNav
      directly decodes the pgns 126992 and 129029 to internally set date and
      time. It can also generate a RMC record internally (if valid position data
      is received via NMEA0183).</p>
    <p>To setup the connections following configuration settings are necessary
      within avnav_server.xml. Our images have them preconfigured, otherwise
      they can be copied &amp; pasted from the template at
      /usr/lib/avnav/raspberry/avnav_server.xml.</p>
    <div class="code">&lt;AVNSocketWriter port="34568" maxDevices="5" <br>   filter=""read="true" minTime="50" <br>   name="nmea0183tosignalk" <br>   blackList="canboatnmea0183,canboatgen"/&gt;
&lt;AVNSocketReader port="2599" host="localhost" filter="" name="canboatnmea0183"/&gt;
&lt;AVNPluginHandler&gt;<br>  &lt;builtin-canboat enabled="true" allowKeyOverwrite="true" autoSendRMC="30" sourceName="canboatgen"/&gt;<br>&lt;/AVNPluginHandler&gt;</div>
    <p>The first entry defines an additional output port for AvNav. This port
      provides all received/created NMEA 0183 data - excluding data received
      from canboat. This port is used for SignalK integration. Canboat data are
      omitted as signalk directly reads data from the NMEA 2000 bus.</p>
    <p>The SocketReader at localhost:2599 reads NMEA0183 data from n2kd.</p>
    <p>Direct reading of NMEA2000 data from n2kd is handled by a plugin.
      Therefore an entry has to be created in AVNPluginHandler. The settings as
      in above example activate the plugin.&nbsp; allowKeyOverwrite permits the
      plugin to set date and time.&nbsp; autoSendRMC=30 will advise AvNav to
      send out a RMC record every one second (if no other RMC records are seen
      within 30 seconds). For further explanation of the plugin parameters refer
      to the <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav/blob/master/server/plugins/canboat/plugin.py">source
        code</a>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>AvNav is currently not prepared to output data to NMEA2000. If this is
      required, you can handle this via signalk.</p>
    <p><br>

    <h2><a name="SignalK" id="SignalK"></a>SignalK</h2>
    <p>With version 20220421 the integration of AvNav with <a href="http://signalk.org/">SignalK</a>
      has been extended.</p>
    <img alt="SignalK" src="SignalK.png" width="800">
    <p>As a first step when integrating AvNav with SignalK you need to decide
      about the basic flow of data.<br>
      There are 2 basic options: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>NMEA data will be received directly by AvNav and will be forwarded to
        SignalK. This flow is used in the&nbsp; <a href="../install.html#Headless">AvNav
          headless images</a>.&nbsp; SignalK data are sent back (via HTTP-Json
        and websocket) to AvNav and can be displayed there.<br>
        The data that is used by AvNav for navigation (including AIS data) will
        be decoded from the NMEA data directly by AvNav.<br>
        Exception: NMEA2000 data that are received via canboat will have to be
        sent in parallel to SignalK.</li>
      <li>NMEA data will be received by SignalK first and will be sent to via
        HTTP-Json and websocket to AvNav.<br>
        This flow is used by OpenPlotter e.g..</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For both variants AvNav can also send own data to SignalK. Currently
      those are routing data to the next way point (either as RMB/APB NMEA0183
      data or as SignalK delta update - see below).</p>
    <p>Additionally Notifications (Alarms) can be fetched and sent from/to
      SignalK.</p>
    <p>With the version 20220421 the SignalK integration is not any longer
      handled by a plugin but by a dedicated "handler" - AVNSignalKHandler. You
      need to modify the <a href="#configuration">Configuration</a> at this
      handler now.</p>
    <h3><a name="flow1"></a>1. NMEA to AvNav and from there to SignalK</h3>
    <p>This flow is preconfigured in the <a href="../install.html#Headless">AvNav
        headless images</a>.</p>
    <p>A AVNSocketWriter is created in AvNav (default: port 34568). This writer
      will forward received NMEA data. Forwarding of data from canboat will be
      prevented by blacklist entries.</p>
    <div class="code">&lt;AVNSocketWriter port="34568" maxDevices="5" filter="" read="true" minTime="50" name="nmea0183tosignalk" blackList="canboatnmea0183,canboatgen"/&gt;</div>
    <p>On the SignalK side you need to configure a matching data connection for
      NMEA0183, TCP client.</p>
    <p>By default the AVNSignalKHandler is configured to reach SignalK via
      localhost:3000 and to read all data below vessels/self. Those values will
      be stored in AvNav below gps.signalk,... and this way can be used
      for&nbsp; <a href="layouts.html">Displays</a>.<br>
      For fetching the data a mixture of polling with HTTP-Json and delta
      updates via a websocket connection is used. The polling will ensure proper
      sync of data, the websocket stream will give fast updates.</p>
    <p>On the configured SocketWriter connection AvNav will also send its
      routing data as RMB / APB Sätze towards SignalK.<br>
      Additionally you can enable the sending and receiving of SignalK
      notifications at the AVNSignalKHandler.</p>
    <p>Data that is arriving directly at SignalK via other pathes will be
      available in AvNav (as described below gps.signalk...) -&nbsp; <b>but
        they cannot be used for AvNav's navigation functions</b>.</p>
    <p>If you would like to route your data to SignalK first you should have a
      look at the <a href="#flow2">other data flow</a>. </p>
    <p>An advantage of flow 1 (NMEA to AvNav first) is the fact that this would
      still work even is SignalK is not available or not working for some
      reason.</p>
    <h3><a name="flow2" id="flow2"></a>2. NMEA to SignalK first</h3>
    <p>With this flow (that is preconfigured at OpenPlotter from AvNavInstaller
      version xxxx) NMEA will be received and stored by SignalK. You need to
      configure the necessary data connections in SignalK.</p>
    <p>In AvNav you configure the AVNSignalKHandler to fetch the data from
      SignalK in a combination of HTTP-Json and a websocket delta update
      connection.<br>
      The flags "decodeData" and "fetchAis" will be set (see <a href="#configuration">Configuration</a>).
      This way received data will be stored in AvNav for it's navigation
      functions. Additionally the data will be stored (a second time) as
      described at <a href="#flow1">(1)</a> below gps.signalk.... to ensure
      compatibility for the display usage.<br>
      For the mapping of the received data refer to [<a href="#mapping">Mapping</a>].</p>
    <p>Additionally the sending of data ("sendData") is activated at the
      AVNSignalKhandler. Routing data for the current way point and alarms will
      be sent to SignalK.<br>
      Notifications from SignalK will be received.<br>
      To be able to write data to SignalK you have to configure a user with
      write access at SignalK (see <a href="#configuration">Configuration</a>).</p>
    <p>The NMEA connections to and from SignalK (port 10110) are not necessary
      any longer. You also do not need any plugin at SignalK to create NMEA data
      for sending it to AvNav.</p>
    <p>If you update from an older version you can just simply disable the NMEA
      connections and adapt the settings of AVNSignalKHandler.</p>
    <h3>Selection of the Data Flow</h3>
    <p>For a decision whether to use <a href="#flow1">flow 1</a> (NMEA to AvNav
      first) or <a href="#flow2">flow 2</a> (NMEA to SignalK first) you can
      start from the default of your installation.</p>
    <p>You should only change it if there are good reasons for. By using the
      configuration at the&nbsp; <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/status.svg"
        alt="" class="inlineimage"> <a href="../userdoc/statuspage.html">status/server
        page</a> you can configure your flow. You can even create mixtures of
      them.</p>
    <p>You only have to be careful to avoid loops - e.g. sending data from AvNav
      via NMEA0183 to SignalK and getting it back from SignalK again via
      NMEA0183.<br>
      AvNav tries to address such mixed configurations with a "sourcePriority"
      at every connection. All NMEA connections have a default priority of 50
      compared to a default of 40 for The AVNSignalKHandler. This way data that
      is decoded by AvNav itself will always win against data received from
      SignalK (until you change the priorities).</p>
    <h3>Konfiguration</h3>
    <p>The AVNSignalKHandler has the following configuration.</p>

    <p>SignalK notifications without a mapping will be assigned to a category
      based on their state. With the catgeory you can define in
      AVNCommandHandler which command should be executed and which sound should
      be used.</p>

    <h3>SignalK - Charts </h3>
    <p>Since version 202011xx an integration of the <a href="https://github.com/SignalK/charts-plugin">SignalK
        chart provider</a> is available. Charts provided by SignalK can be
      selected on the main page. You have to enable the chart provider plugin
      within SignalK and configure/upload charts.</p>
    <p>Normally AvNav will just provide the information about these charts, the
      browser will directly access SignalK to load the chart tiles.</p>
    <p>If this is blocked (e.g. by firewall rules) you can proxy all chart tile
      requests via AvNav. </p>
