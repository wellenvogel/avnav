    <h1>Interworking with Canboat and SignalK</h1>
    <p>Starting with release 20200204 AvNav can interwork with canboat
      (NMEA2000) and signalk.</p>
    <h2><a name="Canboat" id="Canboat"></a>Canboat (NMEA2000)</h2>
    <p>Using <a href="https://github.com/canboat/canboat">canboat</a> you can
      interface to NMEA 2000 bus systems using a CAN adapter (e.g. <a href="https://www.reichelt.de/entwicklerboards-can-modul-mcp2515-mcp2562-debo-can-modul-p239277.html">MCP2515</a>
      or a <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RS485_CAN_HAT">Waveshare
        RS485 CAN-HAT</a> ) or USB attached devices like the Actisene NGT-1. For
      simple adapters you need to ensure that they have 2 voltage supplies (3.3V
      and 5V) to be usable for the raspberry pi. Many of the simple ones do not
      have that!</p>
    <img title="Canboat" alt="" src="Canboat.png" width="800">
    <p>In the picture the basic set up is shown as we provide it with the <a href="../install.html#Headless">headless
        images</a>. </p>
    <p>If you connect a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=141052">CAN
        adapter</a> via <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/spi/README.md">SPI</a>
      typically you need to enable an overlay in /boot/config.txt. For using the
      MCP2515 appropriate entries are prepared and only need to be uncommented.
      Potentially you have to adapt the clock frequency and the GPIO ping you
      use for the interrupt. Such can adapters will appear as a network
      interface (potentially this needs configuration but is already there if
      you use the images).<br>
      The interface should be visible with</p>
    <div class="code">ifconfig can0</div>
    <p>If you are going to use an Actisense NGT-1 connected via USB refer to the
      <a href="https://github.com/canboat/canboat/wiki/actisense-serial">documentation
        at canboat</a>.</p>
    <p>AvNav is communicating with <a href="https://github.com/canboat/canboat/wiki/n2kd">n2kd</a>.
      This daemon is converting received NMEA2000 data into NMEA0183 (although
      not completely).The configuration for n2kd is located at</p>
    <div class="code">/etc/default/n2kd</div>
    <p>Within our images in this file there is a connection prepared to can0. If
      you are going to use an USB based adapter you have to change this
      configuration.<br>
      In this case please also create an entry in avnav_server.xml to disable
      this adapter for auto detection (look at the AvNav status page during
      connecting the adapter, get it's USB id from there an use this for the
      entry):</p>
    <div class="code">&lt;AVNUsbSerialReader .....&gt;<br>&lt;UsbDevice usbid="x:y.z" type="ignore"/&gt; <br>....</div>
    <p>If everything is set up correctly you should be able to see NMEA data /
      json data at the ports 2599 and 2598 if there is traffic at the NMEA 2000
      bus. You can check this with</p>
    <div class="code">nc localhost 2599</div>
    <p>If you are unable to see data you can check the canboat status with</p>
    <div class="code">sudo systemctl status canboat</div>
    <p>There should be 2 connections from AvNav to n2kd (prepared in the
      images). On one connection (port 2599) AvNav is receiving NMEA0183 data
      and on the other connection (port 2598) directly some of the json data.
      The latter is necessary as n2kd does not provide any NMEA0183 record
      containing a complete time stamp (like RMC). To get the data from NMEA2000
      AvNav is able to directly decode the pgns 126992,129029 to internally set
      date and time and is alos able to generate an RMC record internally (if
      valid position data is received via NMEA0183).</p>
    <p>For setting up the connections the following configurations within
      avnav_server.xml are necessary. By using our images they already will be
      there otherwise you can find them in the template at
      /usr/lib/avnav/raspberry/avnav_server.xml and can copy them from there.</p>
    <div class="code">&lt;AVNSocketWriter port="34568" maxDevices="5" <br>   filter=""read="true" minTime="50" <br>   name="nmea0183tosignalk" <br>   blackList="canboatnmea0183,canboatgen"/&gt;
&lt;AVNSocketReader port="2599" host="localhost" filter="" name="canboatnmea0183"/&gt;
&lt;AVNPluginHandler&gt;<br>  &lt;builtin-canboat enabled="true" allowKeyOverwrite="true" autoSendRMC="30" sourceName="canboatgen"/&gt;<br>&lt;/AVNPluginHandler&gt;</div>
    <p>With the first entry an additional output port will be created for AvNav.
      On this one it will provide all it's received/created NMEA 0183 data - but
      without the data received from canboat. This port will be used for
      integrating with signalk as signalk will directly receive the data from
      the NMEA 2000 bus.</p>
    <p>The SocketReader at localhost:2599 will receive the NMEA0183 data from
      n2kd.</p>
    <p>The direct reading of NMEA2000 data from n2kd is handled by a plugin.
      Therefor an entry has to be created below AVNPluginHandler. With the
      settings in the example above the plugin will be activated,
      allowKeyOverwrite will allow the plugin to set date and time and
      autoSendRMC=30 will ensure that AvNav will send out an RMC record every 1s
      if there is no other RMC within it's NMEA data. For an explanation of the
      plugin parameters refer to the <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav/blob/master/server/plugins/canboat/plugin.py">source
        code</a>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>AvNav is currently not prepared to send out data on NMEA2000. If this is
      required, you can handle this via signalk.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="SignalK" id="SignalK"></a>SignalK</h2>
    <p>Starting from 20200204 a first step of interworking with <a href="http://signalk.org/">SignalK</a>
      is possible.</p>
    <img alt="SignalK" src="SignalK.png" width="800">
    <p>In the set up we provide in the images AvNav will send out all it's data
      received as NMEA0183 towards signalk. THe only exception is the data
      received from canboat. On the signalk side you have to configure an
      appropriate channel for that (again already available in the images). On
      AvNav side the port is 34568 (see above).</p>
    <p>To get all data from signalk AvNav is polling (once per second) the URL</p>
    <div class="code">http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/api/vessels/self</div>
    <p>and will store all the "value" entries locally below</p>
    <div class="code">gps.signalk....</div>
    <p>This way the data is available to the app and can be displayed in
      widgtes. A ready to go <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav/blob/master/server/plugins/signalk/example.json">layout</a>
      is available and you can adapt this one - or your own - via the <a href="layouts.html">layout
        editor</a>.&nbsp; You can select the layout on the <a href="../userdoc/settingspage.html">settings
        page</a>&nbsp; (system.plugin.builtin-signalk.example) - it will only be
      visible if the signalk plugin is enabled.</p>
    <p>Fetching data from signalk is handled by a plugin that has to be
      configured. The images already contain the valid configuration, otherwise
      you will find it again at the template
      /usr/lib/avnav/raspberry/avnav_server.xml:</p>
    <div class="code">&lt;AVNSocketWriter port="34568" maxDevices="5" filter="" read="true" minTime="50" name="nmea0183tosignalk" blackList="canboatnmea0183,canboatgen"/&gt;
&lt;AVNPluginHandler&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;builtin-signalk enabled="true"/&gt;
&lt;/AVNPluginHandler&gt;</div>
    <p>If you also use the canboat integration please do only create one
      AVNPluginHandler entry and configure both plugins below it.<br>
      As SignalK is receiving all NMEA0183 data an active waypoint will be
      visible there (sent via $RMB).<br>
      If the plugin is enabled a <a href="../userdoc/addonpage.html">user app</a>
      entry will be visible for signalk showing the Web UI.</p>
    <p>In principle you could also set up other configurations (e.g. AvNav is
      receiving it's NMEA data from signalk and does only send RMB back). A
      similar set up will be used in OpenPlotter. In any case you have to be
      careful not to create any loops. In AvNav you can use at the SocketReaders
      the filter and&nbsp; name options and at the writers the filter,
      readFilter and blackList options. In this set up you could also handle the
      canboat integration via signalk.</p>
    <p>The following plugin parameters are available:</p>

    <h3><a name="SignalKCharts" id="SignalKCharts"></a>SignalK - Charts</h3>
    <p>Since version 202011xx an integration of the <a href="https://github.com/SignalK/charts-plugin">SignalK
        chart provider</a> is available. Charts provided by SignalK can be
      selected on the main page. At SignalK you have to enable the chart
      provider plugin and you have to configure/upload charts.</p>
    <p>Normally AvNav will just provide the information about the charts, the
      browser will directly access SignalK for the chart tiles.</p>
    <p>If this is not possible (e.g. prevented by some firewall rules) you can
      proxy all chart tile requests via AvNav. </p>
    <p>There is a couple of new parameters in the plugin for the chart handling.
      Normally you can leave them at their defaults.</p>
