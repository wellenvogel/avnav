    <h1>Avnav Ocharts(NG)</h1>
    <div class="toc" data-maxlevel="3"></div>
    <p>AvNav ochartsng is a new implementation of the <a href="ocharts.html">AvNav
        ocharts plugin</a>.<br>
      This implementation has a couple of new features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Now also available on Android (see <a href="#android">below</a>)</li>
      <li>Has a direct (online) Shop interface</li>
      <li>Can now also handle unencrypted S57 charts (after some initial
        <a href="#chartconversions"> conversion</a>)</li>
      <li>Has more options for adapting the display</li>
      <li>Avoids the large disk caches that created a lot of SD card write load
        and a lot of CPU load</li>
      <li>Does not need to restart to handle newly uploaded charts</li>
      <li>Can utilize more cores of the processors and should run faster on many
        systems</li>
      <li>Has fewer external dependencies - especially it does not need a
        working X11 environment any more</li>
      <li>Utilizes less memory</li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a name="restrictions"></a>Currently this implementation is in a beta
      status. So there are / could be some restrictions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Handling of oeRNC charts (raster charts) is still not implemented</li>
      <li>There could be bugs in the display or in some handling flows</li>
      <li>On Android you cannot use the same licens for OpenCPN and for AvNav</li>
      <li>You should not run AvNav ocharts and OpenCPN at the same time on
        Android</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <div class="toc"> </div>
    <p>AvNav is able to handle charts in various raster formats. So far it was
      unable to handle any commercial charts. The&nbsp; <a href="https://o-charts.org/">o-charts</a>
      company supplies charts for various regions of the world for usage in
      OpenCPN.</p>
    <p>After some agreements with o-charts, those charts can now also be used
      for AvNav (starting with version 2024xxx with this new plugin - <a href="#Installation">see
        below</a>). At present you can use oeusenc vector-charts .</p>
    <p>To display those charts in AvNav they must be rendered into raster
      images. This is handled by a new plugin for AvNav(avnav-ochartsng). The
      rendering takes place on the fly whenever tiles are to be displayed. A
      certain amount of rendered chart data (tiles) is kept in memory on the
      server to serve them fast if you switch between certain zoom levels or if
      you run multiple displays.</p>
    <p>All oeSENC charts handling is performed by the plugin - including
      installation (you cannot install them directly via the <span style="color: #0000ee;">d</span><a
        href="../userdoc/downloadpage.html">ownload page</a>). For this purpose
      a dedicated GUI is offered by the plugin. You enter it from the main page
      via <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/apps.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">(User
      Apps) and&nbsp; Ocharts-Provider&nbsp; <img src="ochartsngicon.png" alt=""
        class="inlineimage">.</p>
    <p> <img src="ochartsng-gui1.png" class="fimage"></p>
    <br>
    <h2>Chart Types</h2>
    <p>AvNav ochartsng can handle the o-charts vector charts (oeusenc) as
      described in this document.<br>
      Additionally it can also handle unencrypted vector charts - like S57
      charts available for download for various regions.<br>
      To use S57 charts they need to be converted into the OpenCPN format that
      AvNav-ochartsng understands. <br>
      For details on how to convert charts refer to <a href="#chartconversions">Chart
        Conversions</a>.</p>
    <h2><a name="Charts"></a>Buying and Installing the Charts</h2>
    <p>Important Hint: <span style="color: #ff6666;">If you do not have a
        dongle from o-charts, your chart license is bound to your system. So in
        case of any trouble <b>do not</b> set up a new system (by writing an
        image to an SD card) but instead try to repair the system. If you set up
        a new system you will lose your license. I will by happy to support in
        case of trouble - contact e.g. via <a href="mailto:andreas@wellenvogel.net">email</a>.</span></p>
    <p>To be able to buy charts at o-charts you have to create an account at <a
        href="https://o-charts.org/shop/en/autenticacion?back=my-account">their
        site</a> first.<br>
      Afterwards you have to register the systems you would like to buy charts
      for <a href="https://o-charts.org/shop/en/module/occharts/occharts">at
        the o-charts site</a>.<br>
      You have two different ways to do this - named the "<a href="https://o-charts.org/manuals/?lng=en">online
        process</a> " and the <a href="https://o-charts.org/manuals/offline.php?lng=en">"Offline"
        process</a> . <br>
      The online process requires that your system (the one running the AvNav
      server - not necessarily the one running the browser!) is connected to the
      internet.<br>
      For Android the registration of the system is only possible with the
      online process.</p>
    <h3><a name="offlineprocess"></a>The Offline Process</h3>
    <p>This process consists of the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a "fingerprint" for the system you would like to use the charts
        at. In AvNav you will create it in the GUI for the plugin and download
        from there.</li>
      <li>Upload the fingerprint to o-charts and create a system (basically
        assigning a name).</li>
      <li>Buy charts</li>
      <li>Assign charts to the system you created</li>
      <li>After a short time you will receive an email from o-charts with a
        download link (zip file).</li>
      <li>Upload charts to AvNav (via the plugin GUI).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For updates repeat steps 4, 5 and 6 (only requesting the notification
      mail at step 4).<br>
      For further chart sets steps 3-6.<br>
      For steps 2,3,4 and 5 you need a system with internet connectivity. You
      can e.g. use a laptop or an android device.<span style="color: red;"><br>
        Important hint for Android</span>: The registration of the system (Steps
      1 and 2) cannot be handled using the offline process. You have to use the
      <a href="#onlineprocess">online process</a> for those steps. Buying
      charts, assigning them, downloading and installing them can be also done
      with the offline process. </p>
    <p>I created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q24VRAtbbEE">video</a>
      to demonstrate the offline process. Additionally here is a short
      description.</p>
    <p><b>Hint</b>: If the charts are already registered on the same system (for
      OpenCPN) you can directly continue at step 6 (but not for android - see <a
        href="#restrictions">restrictions</a> above). </p>
    <h4>Creating the fingerprint</h4>
    <p>Via <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/apps.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">-&gt;<img
        src="ochartsngicon.png" class="inlineimage"> you enter the GUI of the
      plugin, select the "Charts" tab.</p>
    <img src="ochartsng-gui-charts1.png" class="fimage">
    <p>Use "Get Fingerprint" to create the fingerprint file. If you are using an
      o-charts dongle - just select "Get Fingerprint(Dongle)". The dongle button
      will only be visible if a dongle has been detected (dongle line is green).</p>
    <p><img src="ochartsng-gui-charts2.png" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>Choose Download to save the created file on your device.</p>
    <h4>Uploading the fingerprints to o-charts</h4>
    <p>Enter the&nbsp; <a href="https://o-charts.org/shop/en/module/occharts/occhartsOesu">o-charts
        page</a> and upload the fingerprint.</p>
    <img src="ocharts-buying.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>With "Choose File" you select the file stored at step 2. Assign a
      meaningful name to the new system - this will be part of the mails you
      will receive later.</p>
    <h4>Buying the Charts</h4>
    <p>Select the desired charts from <a href="https://o-charts.org/shop/en/8-oesenc">oeSENC
        charts</a>.</p>
    <h4>Assigning to your System</h4>
    <img src="ocharts-assign.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>At 1 you can assign charts to your system (in this screenshot this is not
      available anymore as the max amount of 2 systems are already assigned). At
      2 you request the mail holding the download link (you would do the same
      for updates - in the screenshot: last version I have downloaded is 21,
      latest available is 23)</p>
    <h4>Downloading the Charts</h4>
    <img src="ocharts-download.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>After a short time you will receive a mail containing the download link
      for your charts. Download the zip file.</p>
    <h4>Uploading the Zip File to AvNav</h4>
    <p><img src="ochartsng-upload1.png" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>In the plugin's GUI select "Upload Zip" to transfer the zip file
      downloaded in step 5 to AvNav.</p>
    <p>There will be a progress bar during upload.</p>
    <p><img src="ochartsng-upload2.png" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>After the upload is completed the zip file will be unpacked. Some initial
      checks can take some time.</p>
    <p>Unless configured otherwise, the charts will be uploaded to
      /home/pi/avnav/data/ocharts/charts.</p>
    <p> If the newly uploaded chart contains updates to an already existing set,
      the existing set will be deactivated. You may change this later on by
      using Enable/Disable/Auto. Chart sets not required anymore can be deleted.
    </p>
    <p>Important hint: As the charts will only be available at the o-charts page
      as long as they are valid just keep the downloaded zip file at a safe
      place. You can still upload and use those charts at AvNav ochartsng even
      after the validity period (but you will not receive any updates).</p>
    <p>After all charts are successfully read the status should change to green
      (READY).</p>
    <p><img src="ochartsng-upload4.png" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>If the status turns to "ERROR" (red) you maybe uploaded a zip that was
      not built for your current system. You can check details in the log file
      at /home/pi/avnav/data/ocharts/provider.log.</p>
    <p>Now the charts are available and can be used.</p>
    <p><img src="ocharts-mainpage.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p><img src="ocharts-navpage.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h3><a name="onlineprocess"></a>The Online Process</h3>
    <p>For using the online process your system (the server that runs AvNav -
      not necessarily the one that you run your browser on) needs internet
      connectivity.</p>
    <p>It will allow you to register your system, check if it is known in the
      ocharts shop, list charts or updates being available for download,
      download and install them.<br>
      Currently the buying process and the assignments of the charts have to be
      done on the o-charts web site. But the GUI will contain a link button to
      go there.<br>
      The AvNav ochartsng will not store any shop credentials. But as you run
      inside a browser you can easily use your browser to store the credentials
      (like you do on any other web site).</p>
    <p>Security hint: Although the communication with the ocharts shop is
      secured by SSL the communication between your browser and the AvNav server
      is not. So when you are using the online process just be sure to work
      within a secured network (e.g. behind an LTE router or a mobile phone
      hotspot) - not within a public open Wifi network.</p>
    <p><img src="ochartsng-shop1.png" alt="" class="fimage"> </p>
    <p>When opening the "shop" tab you will not be logged in and you will see an
      info whether a dongle is active on your system or not. Via the "ShopPage"
      button you can directly access the o-charts web page (but better log in
      first...).</p>
    <p>With tapping "Login" you will login to the o-charts shop. </p>
    <p><img src="ochartsng-shoploggedin.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>When the shop already knows your current system the "Shop name" will be
      shown and the list of available charts/updates that have been assigned to
      your system (see <a href="#offlineprocess">OfflineProcess</a>) will be
      visible.<br>
      If a version in the shop is newer then your local version (or the chart is
      not locally available) you can immediately install it.</p>
    <p><img src="ochartsng-shopupdate.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p><img src="ochartsng-shopdownload.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>After downloading the chart will be unpacked and can immediately be used.
      If it is an update for an existing chart set, the new version will become
      active but the old one will still be available (similar handling like
      uploading a chart zip file). On the chart tab you can later on delete the
      older version if you don't need this any more.</p>
    <p><span style="color: red;">Important hint</span>:<br>
      As the charts in the shop will only remain available for download as long
      as they are valid (one year) please store the charts additionally at a
      safe place. You can either do this from the shop website by requesting the
      charts (like in the offline process). Or you can download the chart set
      from the "charts" tab (Download button).</p>
    <p>If your system is still not known to the shop you are able to register it
      there.</p>
    <p><img src="ochartsng-shopunknown.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    On linux systems you will be prompted for a system name but on android the
    system name is fixed and cannot be changed.<br>
    <p>After you registered your system you can click the "ShopPage" link and
      start assigning charts to your system. When coming back to the shop tab
      you need to tap "Refresh" to get the list of charts that have been
      assigned.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="MainSettings"></a>Adapting the Look and Feel</h2>
    <p>As the o-charts are vector charts you can adjust their look and feel.
      However some limitations must be considered:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The modifications apply to the server's chart settings - so they will
        become effective for all displays.</li>
      <li>If you change the look and feel all data in the internal cache is
        wiped and the chart tiles must be rendered from scratch. So this will
        (potentially) introduce some delays on systems with less computing
        power.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Changing display parameters is done in the plugin GUI(<img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/apps.svg"
        alt="" class="inlineimage">-&gt;<img src="ochartsngicon.png" class="inlineimage">),
      tab "Main Settings".</p>
    <img src="ochartsng-settings1.png" class="fimage">
    <p>If you change a setting (1) it will be displayed bold. Changes will only
      become effective when you click "Update Settings"(2).<br>
      When you changed the settings the chart display will be rebuild. This will
      typically cause a small delay with no display at all.</p>
    <p>By selecting "Cancel" you can revert your changes. "Defaults" will reset
      to the built-in defaults. Most parameters are similar to the ones you find
      at&nbsp; <a href="https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=opencpn:opencpn_user_manual:options_setting">OpenCPN
        settings</a>.</p>
    <p>The following parameters are available.</p>

    <h2><a name="Installation"></a>Installation</h2>
    <h3>Linux/Raspberry</h3>
    <p>The plugin is available as a debian package.<br>
      As the plugin is currently in a beta phase, the packages are still not
      part of the official repositories.</p>
    <p>For the <a href="../install.html#Headless">AvNav Images</a> the
      necessary packages can be found in the beta repository. To enable it you
      can edit the file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/extra.list to enable the beta
      repository.<br>
      Start the editor with:</p>
    <div class="code">sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/extra.list</div>
    <div class="code"><span style="color: red;">#</span>deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/oss.boating.gpg] https://www.free-x.de/debpreview bullseye main contrib non-free
    deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/oss.boating.gpg] https://www.free-x.de/debian bullseye main contrib non-free</div>
    <p>Just remove the hash mark at the debpreview line. Afterwards you can
      install the package normally with the avnav updater:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>avnav-ochartsng</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you want to do this from the command line execute:</p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <div class="code">sudo apt-get update<br>sudo apt-get install avnav-ochartsng<br>sudo systemctl restart avnav</div>
    <p>If you are working on other images you should add the repository from
      free-x (adapt "bullseye" to your debian release):</p>
    <p>Refer to the <a href="../install.html#Packages">AvNav package install
        description</a>.</p>
    <div class="code">deb https://www.free-x.de/debpreview bullseye main contrib non-free</div>
    <p>Alternatively you can download the packages them from the <a href="../../downloads/daily-ochartsng">daily
        builds directory</a>.</p>
    <p>To use one of those packages just download and install the package
      (replace the version by the one you want): </p>
    <div class="code">cd /home/pi/avnav<br>wget -O avnav-ochartsng_20240214-raspbian-bullseye_armhf.deb https://www.wellenvogel.net/software/avnav/downloads/daily-ochartsng/20240214/avnav-ochartsng_20240214-raspbian-bullseye_armhf.deb<br>sudo apt install ./avnav-ochartsng_20240214-raspbian-bullseye_armhf.deb<br>sudo systemctl restart avnav</div>
    <h2><a name="Releases"></a></h2>
    <p> You can also download to a PC, transfer by scp/WinScp to the pi and
      install then. </p>
    <h4>AvNav-ocharts and AvNav-ochartsng Together</h4>
    <p>When you install the new avnav-ochartsng-plugin you will get some
      conflict with the existing ocharts plugin. At the end both will try to use
      the same port - so at least one of the two will fail to start.<br>
      The suggested solution is to disable the ocharts-plugin on the&nbsp;<img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/status.svg"
        alt="" class="inlineimage"> <a href="../userdoc/statuspage.html">server/status
        page</a>.<br>
      Additionally enable the "useLegacy" switch in the <a href="#PluginConfig">PluginConfig</a>
      of the ochartsng plugin. This way the new plugin will also use all the
      charts that you installed with the old one.</p>
    <p>If you would like to run both plugins in parallel change the port of the
      ochartsng plugin to e.g. 8083. Running both in parallel should only be
      done if your system has sufficient RAM (at least 2GB).</p>

    <h2><a name="Details"></a></h2>
    <h2><a name="android"></a>Android App</h2>
    <p>AvNav OchartsNG also runs on Android and provides charts for the <a href="../android/android.html">AvNav
        android app</a>.<br>
      The Ocharts support is built into a separate Android App - avocharts.</p>
    <p>Currently the app is not (yet) available in the google play store as it
      is still in beta status. So you need to download it from the <a href="../../downloads/daily-ochartsng">daily
        builds directory</a> and install it (allow external sources).</p>
    <p><img src="ochartsng-android-main.jpg" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>After you started up avocharts for the first time you can adapt some
      settings.<br>
      When you see this picture the real ocharts provider process is still not
      running - it will start up when you tap "start".</p>
    <p><a name="androidstartup"></a>Later it will not be necessary to start the
      avocharts app by hand - it should normally being started automatically
      when AvNav starts up. But directly starting the avocharts app can help to
      troubleshoot as you can get access to the output and log of the chart
      provider.<br>
      Please consider that the auto start will only work for apps of the same
      type - i.e. an AvNav release app can only start an avocharts release&nbsp;
      app and an AvNav beta app can only start an avocharts beta app.<br>
      So when you install the avocharts beta together with the "normal" AvNav
      app from the store you need to start avocharts by hand before you can use
      the charts in AvNav.</p>

    <p>When the provider process is up an running you will see the indication in

      the output (tapping "OUT") or the log (tapping "LOG").</p>
    <p>Tapping "APP" will open up a browser window with the ochartsng app - the
      same view like you get from within AvNav.</p>
    <p><img src="ochartsng-android-webmain.jpg" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>You now can e.g. register at the ocharts shop (on android this is only
      possible using the Online Process).</p>
    <h3><a name="androidbetarelease"></a>Beta and Release Versions</h3>
    <p>Due to the way that the ocharts license daemon is working you will
      normally not be able to use charts that you installed with the release
      version within the beta version and vice versa.<br>
      To overcome this problem you can export the necessary information from the
      app version that you used to assign the charts and import this in the
      different version. Hint: You still can only use this on the same android
      device!<br>
      To export a key tap the disk symbol on the settings screen within the app
      and store the file at a safe place. When you later use the alternative
      version, select "use alternate key" , tap on the key value and import the
      saved key file there.<br>
      You can easily check if your app has the correct key by going to the shop
      page and log in. When the shop recognizes your current key it will show
      the system name - see <a href="#onlineprocess">Online Process</a>. </p>
    <p>Please also consider the <a href="#androidstartup">automatic startup
        relations</a> between the Beta and Release version.</p>
    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    <p>The charts are provided by an executable that normally serves at port
      8082. <br>
      Communication with AvNav is handled by an AvNav <a href="plugins.html">plugin</a>
      on linux and by the avocharts app on Android.</p>
    <p>The GUI is a reactjs app that is also provided by the executable. It is
      integrated into AvNav as a <a href="../userdoc/addonpage.html">User App</a>.</p>
    <p>You will find the complete code at <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/ochartsng">GitHub</a>.</p>
    <p>You install into /usr/lib/avnav/plugins/ochartsng. The data directory is
      /home/pi/avnav/data/ochartsng. You can set some additional parameters for
      the AvNav plugin by editing <a href="configfile.html">avnav_server.xml</a>.
      Normally this is not necessary at all. </p>
    <p><a name="Upload"></a>You can separately set the directory for all
      settings and the charts: </p>
    <div class="code">&lt;AVNPluginHandler&gt;<br>...<br>&lt;system-ochartsng dataDir="$DATADIR/ochartsng"/&gt;<br>&lt;/AVNPluginHandler&gt;</div>
    <br>
    <p> </p>
    <h3> <a name="chartconversions"></a>Chart Conversions </h3>
    <p>Unencrypted vector charts like S57 charts have to be converted into the
      internally used "SENC" format before they can be handled.<br>
      There are 2 Options to convert such charts.</p>
    <h4>Converting using OpenCPN</h4>
    <p>If you already have a computer with OpenCPN up and running you can let
      OpenCPN convert the charts. To do so you need to activate the charts in
      OpenCPN. On the OpenCPN settings / tab "chart files" just click "Prepare
      all ENC Charts".</p>
    <p><img src="ochartsng-convert-opencpn.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>This will create a lot of files with the s57 extension in the OpenCPN
      directory (~/.opencpn on linux). Just pick the ones with similar names
      like your s57 charts, copy them in a new, empty directory with a name that
      explains the chart set. Afterwards create a text file "Chartinfo.txt" in
      this directory with just one line of text:</p>
    <p class="code">ChartInfo: nameOfTheChart</p>
    <p>Create a zip archive from this directory so that the zip archive has this
      directory inside. This archive can be uploaded to AvNav ochartsng.<br>
      On Linux there is a <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/ochartsng/blob/master/tools/collectS57.sh">script</a>
      to automate this collection process.</p>
    <h4>Converting with a Script</h4>
    <p>The avnav-ochartsng-plugin contains a python script to convert S57 data
      into a zip archive that can be uploaded. So if you have a linux system
      with the plugin being installed you can run the script with</p>
    <p class="code">/usr/lib/anvnav/plugins/ochartsng/tosenc.py input output</p>
    <p>Input can either be a directory with the s57 files (.000,.001,...) or a
      zip file that contains them. Output should be the name of a zip file.</p>
    Later on the converter will be integrated into the AvNav chart converter.
