    <h1>Avnav Overlays</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#configuration">Configuration</a></li>
      <li><a href="#usage">Usage</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since version 202012xx AvNav is able to show additional information
      beside the chart itself in it's chart views. This could be waypoints from
      a GPX file or just available tracks or other data (like e.g. current buoys
      from <a href="http://nautin.nl/wb/pages/navigatie/boeienbestanden/downloaden.php">nautin.nl</a>).</p>
    <p>Additionally you can show multiple charts on top of each other (e.g. an
      OpenSeamap chart that covers a wider range below an <a href="ocharts.html">o-charts</a>
      chart - or just multiple o-charts for different ranges).</p>
    <p>Within AvNav this is named Overlays.</p>
    <p>You can use the following types of data for overlays:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>GPX files (waypoints, tracks, routes)</li>
      <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmzarchives">KML
          and KMZ</a> files (google) - inside the KMZ file you must have a
        doc.kml.</li>
      <li><a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON">geojson</a> files</li>
      <li>other AvNav charts</li>
      <li>AvNav routes</li>
      <li>AvNav tracks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the GPX and KML files you can provide user defined icons or e.g. html
      pages that can be reached via link properties within a zip archive. KMZ
      files normally already contain such kinds of data.</p>
    <p>If you have such overlays visible on a chart you can get available
      additional information by clicking on the symbol on the chart.</p>
    <h2><a name="configuration"></a>Configuration</h2>
    <p>Bevor you can start using the overlays you need to upload them to AvNav.</p>
    <p><img src="DownloadPage-Overlays.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>Within AvNav the symbol <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/layers-black.svg"
        alt="" class="inlineimage">is used for overlays.</p>
    <p>After you uploaded the files you can assign them to the available charts.
      You can define a set of overlays that you would like to show on every
      chart (default overlays). Additionally you can define for each particular
      chart which overlays you would like to see on it.</p>
    <p>You can make those assignments either on the <a href="../userdoc/downloadpage.html">Files/Download
        page</a> at the sub section "charts" - or jsut at the <a href="../userdoc/mainpage.html">Mainpage</a>.</p>
    <p><img src="Overlay-Config-Default-DownloadPage.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>In the picture you can see the dialog that will show up once you click on
      "DefaultOverlays" at the Files/Download page.</p>
    <p>In this dialog you can add, edit or remove overlays.</p>
    <p><img src="Overlay-Config-Default-Select1.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>In the picture you see the dialog that opens on clicking "InsertAfter".<br>
      In the example I selected the file Wegepunkte2020.gpx (<a href="https://nvcharts.com/shop/media/download/Wegepunkte2020_gpx.zip">NV
        Verlag</a>)&nbsp; that has been uploaded to the overlays dir.<br>
      You can now set various Parameters (depending on the type of overlay).</p>
    <table border="1" width="100%">

          <td>true</td>
          <td>If set to false the overlay is configured - but will still not
            show up. You can later on easily show it with one click.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>user icons</td>
          <td>---</td>
          <td>You can select a zip file (that has been uploaded to overlays)
            that contains symbol icons or other content (like html pages).<br>
            If there is a "sym" property within a gpx file (e.g. at a waypoint)
            - like sym="b1" AvNav will try to read a file b1.png from the
            provided zip file to display it at the position.<br>
            If there is s a link property like link="data/1.html" it will be
            searched for an entry data/1.html within the zip file.<br>
            The sam applies for KML files. Normally you would in this case
            better use KMZ files as they already contain all the necessary data.</td>

          <td>With this parameter you can select an icon file (png, svg) that
            will be used if an icon is not found (or you did not fill the user
            icons parameter). You can select from files you have uploaded to
            overlays, to user files or to images.<br>
            With --DefaultGpxIcon-- you can select a built in icon. <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/DefaultGpxPoint.svg"

        </tr>
      </tbody>

    <p>If the overlay contains other data then way points you will potentially
      get more parameters.</p>

      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>After clicking "Ok" the overlay has been added.</p>
    <img src="Overlay-Config-Default-SelectList.png" alt="" class="fimage"><br>
    <p>You can change the order of theoverlays by drag&amp;drop - if you want
      one below the chart you have to move it above the ---chart--- row.</p>
    <p>For the default overlays it could make sense to keep them disabled first
      and only enable them on the charts where you really need them - or just on
      demand.</p>
    <p>For a chart the overlay configuration looks like:</p>
    <img src="Overlay-Config-Default-SelectListNormal.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>The overlays that have been configured as defaults can only be moved (as
      a block) or enabled/disabled. The overlays that have been assigned to the
      chart can be edited.</p>
    <p>You can also reach the overlay configuration from the Mainpage via the <img
        src="../viewerimages/icons-new/layers-black.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">buttton
      beside each chart.</p>
    <p><img src="Overlay-Config-Mainpage.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>The button on the right side will show the configuration for the default
      charts.</p>
    <p>For tracks and routes you can also start the overlay configuration
      directly from a track (gpx file) or a route on the Files/Download page.</p>
    <p><img src="Overlay-Config-Track1.png" alt="" class="fimage"> </p>
    <p>In the picture you see the info dialog that pops up after clicking a gpx
      track. By selecting "Overlays" you can assign this track to charts (or
      remove it).</p>
    <p><img src="Overlay-Config-Track2.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>After deciding whether you would like to assign this to the default
      overlays or to a particular chart the normal overlay configuration dialog
      will pop up.</p>
    <p>If you select "Remove from Charts" this track will be removed from all
      overlays.</p>
    <br>
    <h2><a name="usage"></a>Usage</h2>
    <p>When you have selected a chart for disply it will be shown together with
      the configured overlays.</p>
    <img src="Overlay-Example-Maps-Waypoints.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>In the example there is a o-charts chart together with an OpenStreetMap
      chart (below) and a waypoint file above.<br>
      As default icon the --DefaultGpxIcon-- has been selected.<br>
      If you click on one of the icons of the overlay you will get in Info
      dialog.</p>
    <img src="Overlay-Example-InfoDialog.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>You will see the inforamtion available for this point and you can e.g.
      use this point as a routing target immediately(Goto).<br>
      Using "Hide" you can temporarily disable the complete overlay.<br>
      If you are inside the <a href="../userdoc/editroutepage.html">Route
        Editor</a> there are some more functions available at the info dialog.</p>
    <p><img src="Overlay-Example-InfoDialogRouting.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>The selected point can be added to the route (before or after the current
      selected point) or you can move the current selected route point to the
      position of the shown point.</p>
    <p>If the overlay is a route you can insert this route (starting from the
      selected point) into the current route. This way you can e.g. combine two
      routes.</p>
    <p><img src="Overlay-Example-InfoDialogRouting2.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>At the <a href="../userdoc/navpage.html">Navigation Page</a> and inside
      the <a href="../userdoc/editroutepage.html">Route Editor</a> there is an
      option to temporarily disable or enable overlays.<br>
      This is done using the <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/layers-black.svg"
        alt="" class="inlineimage">button on the right side.</p>
    <p><img src="Overlay-Config-ActiveOverlays.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>The enable and disable settings remain active until you change the chart.
      They are only valid for your current device (in opposite to all other
      overlay configuration functions that will always affect all connected
      devices as they are handled at the server).</p>
    <p>With the Edit button you can change into the normal overlay
      configuration.</p>
    <p><b>Hint:</b></p>
    <p>If you will use overlay files with a lot of elements this can seriously
      impact the display performance. There is currently no fixed limit inside
      AvNav for overlay sizes. Files with several 100MB will for sure lead to
      problems, 1000 points within an overlay are ok.</p>
