    <h1>Avnav Ocharts</h1>
    <p><span style="color: red;">Hint</span>: since 2024/02/17 there is a new
      (Beta) version for the o-charts support. This new version also works on
      android. For a documentation refer to <span style="color: #0000ee;"></span><a
        href="ochartsng.html">OchartsNG</a>.</p>
    <p>=== not for Android ===</p>
    <h3>Inhalt</h3>
    <div class="toc"> </div>
    <p>AvNav is able to handle charts in various raster formats. So far it was
      unable to handle any commercial charts. The&nbsp; <a href="https://o-charts.org/">o-charts</a>
      company supplies charts for various regions of the world for usage in
      OpenCPN.</p>
    <p>After some agreements with o-charts, those charts can now also be used
      for AvNav (starting with version 20200515 with a plugin - <a href="#Installation">see
        below</a>). At present you can use oesenc vector-charts and beginning
      from version 20220225 (and the related change in the o-charts shop - see
      releases below) you can also use oeRNC raster charts.</p>
    <p>To display those charts in AvNav they must be rendered into raster
      images. This is handled by a new plugin for AvNav(avnav-ocharts). The
      rendering takes place on the fly whenever tiles are to be displayed.
      However, major areas of the chart will be prerendered to cached tiles upon
      chart installation. This way those charts can be used the normal way -
      without worring about the rendering process.</p>
    <p>All oeSENC charts handling is performed by the plugin - including
      installation (you cannot install them directly via the <span style="color: #0000ee;">d</span><a
        href="../userdoc/downloadpage.html">ownload page</a>). For this purpose
      a dedicated GUI is offered by the plugin. You enter it from the main page
      via <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/apps.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">(User
      Apps) and&nbsp; Ocharts-Provider&nbsp; <img src="ochartsicon.png" alt=""
        class="inlineimage">.</p>

    <h2><a name="Charts"></a>Buying and Installing the Charts</h2>
    <p>Important Hint: <span style="color: #ff6666;">If you do not have a
        dongle from o-charts, your chart license is bound to your system. So in
        case of any trouble <b>do not</b> set up a new system (by writing an
        image to an SD card) but instead try to repair the system. If you set up
        a new system you will lose your license. I will by happy to support in
        case of trouble - contact e.g. via <a href="mailto:andreas@wellenvogel.net">email</a>.</span></p>
    <p>To be able to buy charts at o-charts you have to create an account at <a
        href="https://o-charts.org/shop/en/autenticacion?back=my-account">their
        site</a> first.</p>
    <p>Afterwards you have to register the systems you would like to buy the
      charts for <a href="https://o-charts.org/shop/en/module/occharts/occharts">there</a>.
      AvNav is using the <a href="https://manuals.o-charts.org/oesenc_en_US.html">"Offline"
        process</a> . </p>
    <p>This process consists of the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a "fingerprint" for the system you would like to use the charts
        at. In AvNav you will create it in the GUI for the plugin and download
        from there.</li>
      <li>Upload the fingerprint to o-charts and create a system (basically
        assigning a name).</li>
      <li>Buy charts</li>
      <li>Assign charts to the system you created</li>
      <li>After a short time you will receive an email from o-charts with a
        download link (zip file).</li>
      <li>Upload charts to AvNav (via the plugin GUI).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For updates repeat steps 4, 5 and 6 (only requesting the notification
      mail at step 4)</p>
    <p>For further chart sets steps 3-6.</p>
    <p>For steps 2,3,4 and 5 you need a system with internet connectivity. You
      can e.g. use a laptop or an android device.</p>
    <p>I created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q24VRAtbbEE">video</a>
      to demonstrate this process. Additionally here is a short description.</p>
    <p><b>Hint</b>: If the charts are already registered on the same system (for
      OpenCPN) you can directly continue at step 6. Alternatively you could also
      configure to access the OpenCPN chart directories at the <a href="#PluginConfig">plugin</a>
      .</p>
    <h3>1. Creating the fingerprint</h3>
    <p>Via <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/apps.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">-&gt;<img
        src="ochartsicon.png" alt="" class="inlineimage"> you enter the GUI of
      the plugin, select the "Charts" tab.</p>
    <img src="ocharts-gui-charts1.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>Use "Get Fingerprint" to create the fingerprint file. If you are using an
      o-charts dongle - just select "Get Fingerprint(Dongle)".</p>
    <p><img src="ocharts-gui-charts2.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>Choose Download to save the created file on your device.</p>
    <h3>2. Uploading the fingerprints to o-charts</h3>
    <p>Enter the&nbsp; <a href="https://o-charts.org/shop/en/module/occharts/occharts">o-charts
        page</a> and upload the fingerprint.</p>
    <img src="ocharts-buying.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>With "Choose File" you select the file stored at step 2. Assign a
      meaningful name to the new system - this will be part of the mails you
      will receive later.</p>
    <h3>3. Buying the Charts</h3>
    <p>Select the desired charts from <a href="https://o-charts.org/shop/en/8-oesenc">oeSENC
        charts</a>.</p>
    <h3>4. Assigning to your System</h3>
    <img src="ocharts-assign.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>At 1 you can assign charts to your system (in this screenshot this is not
      available anymore as the max amount of 2 systems are already assigned). At
      2 you request the mail holding the download link (you would do the same
      for updates - in the screenshot: last version I have downloaded is 21,
      latest available is 23)</p>
    <h3>5. Downloading the Charts</h3>
    <img src="ocharts-download.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>After a short time you will receive a mail containing the download link
      for your charts. Download the zip file.</p>
    <h3>6. Uploading the Zip File to AvNav</h3>
    <p><img src="ocharts-upload1.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>In the plugin's GUI select "Upload Zip" to transfer the zip file
      downloaded in step 5 to AvNav.</p>
    <p>There will be a progress bar during upload.</p>
    <p><img src="ocharts-upload2.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>After the upload is completed the zip file will be unpacked. Some initial
      checks can take some time.</p>
    <p>Unless configured otherwise, the charts will be uploaded to
      /home/pi/avnav/data/ocharts/charts.</p>
    <p><img src="ocharts-upload3.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>After all checks have passed successfully, the dialog will ask to restart
      the plugin to make the charts usable.</p>
    <p>If the newly uploaded chart contains updates to an already existing set,
      the existing set will be deactivated at restart. You may change this later
      on within the GUI. Chart sets not required anymore can be deleted.</p>
    <p>During restart a couple of error messages will be displayed briefly but
      within 30s the status should be at least set to yellow (the plugin is now
      reading all charts).</p>
    <p>After all charts are successfully read the status should change to green
      (READY).</p>
    <p><img src="ocharts-upload4.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>If the status turns to "ERROR" (red) you maybe uploaded a zip that was
      not built for your current system. You can check details in the log file
      at /home/pi/avnav/data/ocharts/provider.log.</p>
    <p>Now the charts are available and can be used.<br>
      At the "Status" tab you can see some more details.</p>
    <img src="ocharts-status-filling.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>In the screenshot you see the process ("FILLING") that was started after
      upload. It pre-renders a major set of chart tiles to a cache file. This
      will help to reduce on-the-fly rendering lags that otherwise would
      (potentially) occur due to the limited resources of the pi. This process
      can be active for several hours. The provider will use one CPU (out of the
      4 available) on a raspberry pi during this time. Once prefill is completed
      cpu usage will dramatically decrease.</p>
    <p>In any case you may immediately start using the charts (the prefill will
      only use the idle time).</p>
    <p><img src="ocharts-mainpage.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p><img src="ocharts-navpage.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>As already mentioned, there is a chance of lagging to occur when you are
      displaying a particular range/zoom of the chart for first time (you will
      notice this especially on the smaller/older pi's). After first usage of an
      area the necessary tiles will be held in the cache file and there should
      be no more lag.</p>
    <h2><a name="MainSettings"></a>Adapting the Look and Feel</h2>
    <p>As the o-charts are vector charts you can adjust their look and feel.
      However some limitations must be considered:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The modifications apply to the server's chart settings - so they will
        become effective for all displays.</li>
      <li>If you change the look and feel all data in the cache have to be wiped
        and all chart tiles must be rendered from scratch. So this will
        (potentially) again induce lag on smaller/older systems. The automatic
        cache prefill process starts again to pre-render a lot of tiles.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Changing display parameters is done in the plugin GUI(<img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/apps.svg"
        alt="" class="inlineimage">-&gt;<img src="ochartsicon.png" alt="" class="inlineimage">),
      tab "Main Settings".</p>
    <img src="ocharts-settings1.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>If you change a setting (1) it will be displayed bold. Changes will only
      become effective when you click "Update Settings"(2).</p>
    <p>By selecting "Cancel" you can revert your changes. "Defaults" will reset
      to the built-in defaults. Most parameters are similar to the ones you find
      at&nbsp; <a href="https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=opencpn:opencpn_user_manual:options_setting">OpenCPN

            cost of the rendering process as they determine the number of charts
            to be processed to generate a single chart tile. Lower values
            normally mean less charts (i.e. being faster) - but there could be
            white areas between chart tiles. The defaults should be a good
            compromise.</td>

          During the next days the shop at o-charts will move to a new
          encryption schema.<br>
          This will require this new version of the AvNav plugin. <b>Additionally
            you need to install the new avnav-ocharts package</b> - at least
          0.9.0.72 (use the avnav update plugin to handle this). The package
          avnav-oesenc is now obsolete and can be removed (but it can also
          remain on the system).<br>
          The handling of the charts does not change and all your old charts
          will continue to work. But once the shop is changed you will not be
          able to download new charts with the old plugin.<br>
          With the new plugin (and the new shop) <b>AvNav will now also be able
            to handle oeRNC</b> charts (like the imray charts for the Med).</li>
        <li>packages will now also be available for the raspberry debian
          bullseye OS versions (both 32 bit and 64 bit)</li>
        <li>the handling for "reduce details on lower zoom levels" does now work
          correctly</li>
        <li>the "under zoom" setting now works better so it's range could be
          extended and the default changed to 4. This avoids some white areas if
          no charts directly matched the required zoom level</li>
        <li>You can now enable the usage of OpenCPN charts on the same system
          directly in the AvNav plugin settings. This will only work for charts
          installed with the new ocharts_pi plugin in OpenCPN.</li>

    <h2><a name="Details"></a>Technical Details</h2>
    <p>The charts are provided by an executable on the raspberry pi that
      normally serves at port 8082. This executable loads the oesenc-pi OpenCPN
      plugin. <br>
      Communication with AvNav is handled by an AvNav <a href="plugins.html">plugin</a>.</p>
    <p>The GUI is a reactjs app that is also provided by the executable. It is
      integrated into AvNav as a <a href="../userdoc/addonpage.html">User App</a>.</p>
    <p>You will find the complete code at <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav-ocharts-provider">GitHub</a>.</p>
    <p>You install into /usr/lib/avnav/plugins/ocharts. The data directory is
      /home/pi/avnav/data/ocharts. You can set some additional parameters for
      the AvNav plugin by editing <a href="configfile.html">avnav_server.xml</a>.
      Normally this is not necessary at all. </p>
    <p><a name="Upload"></a>Since version 20200709 you can separately set the
      directory for uploading the charts: </p>
    <div class="code">&lt;AVNPluginHandler&gt;<br>...<br>&lt;system-ocharts uploadDir="$DATADIR/charts/ocharts"/&gt;<br>&lt;/AVNPluginHandler&gt;</div>
    <p>In this example the directory is set to
      /home/pi/avnav/data/charts/ocharts (normally it is located at
      /home/pi/avnav/data/ocharts/charts). This could be helpful on the&nbsp; <a
        href="../install.html#Touch">touch image</a> as sufficient disk space is
      available only in /home/pi/avnav/data/charts.<br>
