    <p>AvNav is able to handle chart in various raster formats. Until now it was
      unable to handle any charts you can buy officially. There is the company <a
        href="https://o-charts.org/">o-charts</a> that is supplying charts for
      various regions of the world for the usage in OpenCPN.</p>
    <p>After some agreements with them those charts can now (starting with
      version 20200515 with a plugin - <a href="#Installation">see below</a>)
      also being usaed for AvNav. Until now you can use oesenc vector-charts.</p>
    <p>To use those charts in AvNav they have to be rendered into raster images.
      This is handled by a new plugin for AvNav(avnav-ocharts). This rendering
      takes place on the fly whenever the charts should be displayed. This way
      those charts can be used the normal way - without really dealing with the
      rendering process.</p>
    <p>All handling for those charts is completely done by the plugin -
      including the installation (you cannot install them directly via the <span
        style="color: #0000ee;">d</span><a href="../userdoc/downloadpage.html">ownload
        page</a>). There is an own GUI at the plugin for this purpose. You can
      reach it from the main page via <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/apps.svg"
        alt="" class="inlineimage">(User Apps) and&nbsp; Ocharts-Provider&nbsp;

    <h2><a name="Charts"></a>Buying and Installing the Charts</h2>
    <p>Important Hint: <span style="color: #ff6666;">If you do not own a dongle
        from o-charts your chart license is bound to your system. So in case of
        any trouble <b>do not</b> set up a new system (by writing an image to
        an SD card) but instead try to repair the system. If you set up a new
        system you will loose your license. I will by happy to support in case
        of trouble - contact e.g. via <a href="mailto:andreas@wellenvogel.net">email</a>.</span></p>
    <p>To be able to buy charts at o-charts you have to create an account at <a
        href="https://o-charts.org/shop/en/autenticacion?back=my-account">their
        site</a> first.</p>
    <p>Afterwards you have to register the systems you would like to buy the
      charts for <a href="https://o-charts.org/shop/en/module/occharts/occharts">there</a>.
      AvNav is using the <a href="https://manuals.o-charts.org/oesenc_en_US.html">"Offline"
        process</a> . </p>
    <p>This process consist of the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Creating a "fingerprint" for the system you would like to use the
        charts at. In AvNav you will create it in the GUI for the plugin and
        download from there.</li>
      <li>Uploading of the fingerprint to o-charts and creating a system (mainly
        assigning a name).</li>
      <li>Buying charts</li>
      <li>Assigning charts to your created system</li>
      <li>After a short time you will receive an email from o-charts with a
        download link (zip file).</li>
      <li>Uploading the charts to AvNav (via the plugin GUI).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For updates you will have to repeat steps 4,5 and 6 (only requesting the
      mail at step 4)</p>
    <p>For further chart sets steps 3-6.</p>
    <p>For steps 2,3,4 and 5 you will need a system with internet connectivity.
      You can e.g. use a laptop or an android device.</p>
    <p>For this process I created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q24VRAtbbEE">video</a>
      to show the basics. Additionally here is a short description.</p>
    <p><b>Hint</b>: If the charts are already registered at the same system for
      OpenCPN you can directly continue at step 6. Alternatively you could also
      configure the OpenCPN chart directories with o-charts at the <a href="#Chartconfig">plugin</a>
      .</p>
    <h3>1. Creating the fingerprint</h3>
    <p>Via <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/apps.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">-&gt;<img
        src="ochartsicon.png" alt="" class="inlineimage"> reach the GUI of the
      plugin, select the tab "Charts".</p>
    <img src="ocharts-gui-charts1.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>Use "Get Fingerprint" to create the fingerprint file. If you are using an
      o-charts dongle - just use "Get Fingerprint(Dongle)".</p>
    <p><img src="ocharts-gui-charts2.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>Use the dialog to save the created file on your device.</p>
    <h3>2. Uploading the fingerprints to o-charts</h3>
    <p>Go to the&nbsp; <a href="https://o-charts.org/shop/en/module/occharts/occharts">o-charts
        page</a> and upload the fingerprint.</p>
    <img src="ocharts-buying.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>With Choose File select the file you have stored at step 2. Assign a
      meaningful name to the new system - this will be part of the mails you
      will receive later.</p>
    <h3>3. Buying the Charts</h3>
    <p>Select from <a href="https://o-charts.org/shop/en/8-oesenc">oeSENC
        charts</a> the ones you want to buy.</p>
    <h3>4. Assigning to your System</h3>
    <img src="ocharts-assign.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>At 1 you can assign charts to your system (in my pictore not possible any
      more as I already have assigned the max amount of 2 systems). At 2 you
      trigger the mail with the download link (you would do the same for updates
      - in the picture: last version I have downloaded is 21, newest available
      is 23)</p>
    <h3>5. Downloading the Charts</h3>
    <img src="ocharts-download.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>After a short time you will receive a mail containing the download link
      for your charts. Download the zip file.</p>
    <h3>6. Uploading the Zip File to AvNav</h3>
    <p><img src="ocharts-upload1.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>In the GUI of the o-chart plugin use "Upload Zip" to transfer the zip
      file you have downloaded in step 5 to AvNav.</p>
    <p>There will be a progress bar during upload.</p>
    <p><img src="ocharts-upload2.png" alt="" class="fimage">aha</p>
    <p>After the upload is finished the zip file will be unpacked and there will
      be some initial checks on it (this can take some time).</p>
    <p>If you did not configure anything the charts will be uploaded to
      /home/pi/avnav/data/ocharts/charts.</p>
    <p><img src="ocharts-upload3.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>After all checks have been passed the dialog will show up asking you to
      restart the plugin to make the charts usable.</p>
    <p>If the newly uploaded charts have been an update for an already existing
      set the existing one will be deactivated at restart. You can change this
      later on at the GUI. If there are chart sets that you don't need any more
      you can delete them here.</p>
    <p>During the restart there will be a couple of error messages but after
      app. 30s the status should at least be yellow (the plugin is now reading
      all charts).</p>
    <p>After successful reading of all charts the status should change to green
      (READY).</p>
    <p><img src="ocharts-upload4.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>If the status will change to "ERROR" (red) you potentially did upload a
      zip that was not for your current system. You can check details in the log
      file at /home/pi/avnav/data/ocharts/provider.log.</p>
    <p>Now the charts are available and can be used.<br>
      At the "Status" tab you can see some more details.</p>
    <img src="ocharts-status-filling.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>In the picture you see that after uploading a process ("Cache Prefill")
      started that will pre-render chart tiles. This will help to prevent lags
      that otherwise would (potentially) occur due to the limited resources of
      the pi. The cache prefill will pick a couple of tiles for the chart set
      and will render them into a cache file. This will potentially last for
      several hours. The provider will easily use one CPU (out of the 4
      available) on a raspberry pi during this time. Once the prefill is done,
      the cpu usage will dramatically decrease.</p>
    <p>Anyway you can start using the charts immediately (the prefill will only
      use the spare time).</p>
    <p><img src="ocharts-mainpage.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p><img src="ocharts-navpage.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>As already mentioned there is a chance that lags will occur when you are
      using a particular range/zoom of the chart for first time (you will notice
      this espacially on the smaller/older pi's). After the first usage of a
      range the necessary tiles will be in the cache and there should be no lag
      any more.</p>
    <h2><a name="MainSettings"></a>Adapting the Look and Feel</h2>
    <p>As the o-charts are vector charts you can adapt their look and feel.
      Anyway there are some limitations you have to consider:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The adaption takes place at the AvNav server - so it will become
        effective for all displays.</li>
      <li>If you change the look and feel all the data in the cache has to be
        wiped and all chart tiles must be rendered newly. So this will
        (potentially) again introduce some lag on smaller/older systems. Anyway
        the automatich cache prefill process starts again to pre-render a lot of
        tiles.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Changing the display parameters is done in the plugin GUI(<img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/apps.svg"
        alt="" class="inlineimage">-&gt;<img src="ochartsicon.png" alt="" class="inlineimage">),
      tab "Main Settings".</p>
    <img src="ocharts-settings1.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>If you change a setting (1) it will be shown bold. Changes will only
      become effective once you click "Update Settings"(2).</p>
    <p>Using Cancel you can revert your changes. Defaults will set to the
      built-in defaults. Most of the parameters are similar to the ones you find
      at&nbsp; <a href="https://opencpn.org/wiki/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=opencpn:opencpn_user_manual:options_setting">OpenCPN
        settings</a>.</p>
    <p>The following parameters are available.</p>

            of the rendering process as they determine how many charts have to
            be considered when generating one chart tile. Lower values normally
            mean less charts (i.e. being faster) - but there could be white

    <h2><a name="License"></a>License Hints</h2>
    <p>Using the charts in AvNav with the oesenc-pi plugin has been agreed with
      o-charts and therefore is inline with their license conditions.<br>
      You have to agree to the <a href="https://manuals.o-charts.org/docs/EN_rrc_eula_ChartSetsForOpenCPN.html">license
        conditions of o-charts<span style="color: black;">.</span></a>
      Especially it is not allowed to copy the charts or use them on other
      systems then the ones you have licensed them for.</p>
    <p>Access to the charts inside AvNav is only possible from within the local
      net. You can connect at most 5 devices (Clients) at the same time.</p>
    <p>For software licenses see the <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav-ocharts-provider/blob/master/Readme.md">Readme.</a></p>
    <h2><a name="Details"></a>Technical Details</h2>
    <p>The charts are provided by an executable on the raspberry pi that
      normally serves at port 8082. This executable loads the oesenc-pi OpenCPN
      plugin. <br>
      Communication with AvNav is handled via an AvNav <a href="plugins.html">plugin</a>.</p>
    <p>The GUI is a reactjs app that is also provided by the executable. and is
      integrated into AvNav as a <a href="../userdoc/addonpage.html">User App</a>.</p>
    <p>You will find the complete code at <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav-ocharts-provider">GitHub</a>.</p>
    <p>You install into /usr/lib/avnav/plugins/ocharts. The data directory is
      /home/pi/avnav/data/ocharts. You can configure the AvNav plugin within <a
        href="configfile.html">avnav_server.xml</a>. Normally this is not
      necessary at all. If you need to configure anyway this has to be done
      below the Plugin-Manager.</p>
    <div class="code">&lt;AVNPluginHandler&gt;<br>...<br>&lt;system-ocharts port="8082".../&gt;<br>&lt;/AVNPluginHandler&gt;</div>
    <p>For a list of available options refer to the <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav-ocharts-provider/blob/master/avnav-plugin/plugin.py">description
        in the plugin source code</a>.</p>
    <p><a name="Chartconfig"></a>If you e.g. want to use charts that you already
      installed for OpenCPN you can just configure the OpenCPN chart directories
      with o-charts like:</p>
    <div class="code">&lt;AVNPluginHandler&gt;<br>...<br>&lt;system-ocharts chartdir="/my/chartdir1,/my/chartdir2"/&gt;<br>&lt;/AVNPluginHandler&gt;</div>
    <p>Normally the recommendation is anyway to upload the zip files like
      described at&nbsp; <a href="#Charts">charts</a> .</p>
    <p><a name="Upload"></a>Since version 20200709 you can separately set the
      directory for uploading the charts: </p>
    <div class="code">&lt;AVNPluginHandler&gt;<br>...<br>&lt;system-ocharts uploadDir="$DATADIR/charts/ocharts"/&gt;<br>&lt;/AVNPluginHandler&gt;</div>
    <p>In this example the directory is set to
      /home/pi/avnav/data/charts/ocharts (normally it is located at
      /home/pi/avnav/data/ocharts/charts). This could be helpful on the&nbsp; <a
        href="../install.html#Touch">touch image</a> as only in
      /home/pi/avnav/data/charts there is sufficient disk space.<br>
