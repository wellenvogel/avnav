    <h1>User defined css</h1>
    <p>As AvNav is completely browser based (single page app with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">reactjs</a>)
      you can adapt the look and feel with css.</p>
    <p>There is a file user.css intended to be used for your css rules. This
      file is located close to <a href="userjs.html">user.js</a> in
      BASEDIR/user/viewer. (BASEDIR is /home/pi/avnav/data on a pi).</p>
    <p>Via the Files/Download page <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/ic_file_download.svg"
        alt="" class="inlineimage">and the subpage <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/folder_shared.svg"
        alt="" class="inlineimage"> you can directly reach the file to edit it.</p>
    <p><img src="../downloadpage-user.png" alt="" class="fimage"> </p>
    <p>By clicking on the file and selecting "Edit" in the dialog you can start
      the editor. During the first start a template has been created that
      already contains one example.</p>
    <p>A proven workflow is the usage of your browser's developer tools(Chrome,
      Firefox,...), selecting the elements you would like to adapt and testing
      your changes.</p>
    <p>Afterwards you can directly copy the values into user.css and can test
      them (after saving) by reloading the AvNav page.</p>
