    <h1>Layout Adaptation</h1>
    <div class="toc"> </div>
    <p>The displays (widgets) on the navigation page and the dashboard pages are
      controlled by a configuration json file ("layout").A couple of predefined
      layouts are included with AvNav. They all have the "system." name prefix.
      As a user you can define your own layouts and store them (they will have
      the name prefix "user."). Those user layouts will be stored at a folder
      "layout" below the BASEDIR (/home/pi/avnav/data on the raspberry). You can
      directly edit those files, download and upload them - or you can modify
      the layout using the built in layout editor.</p>
    <p>The preferred way of changing a layout should be the layout editor as
      this is the least error prone way.</p>
    <p>Changing the used layout can be done via Settings <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/ic_settings.svg"
        alt="" class="inlineimage">/Layout.</p>
    <h2>Layout Editor</h2>
    <p>You can start the layout editor via the Settings page <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/ic_settings.svg"
        alt="" class="inlineimage">, Layouts <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/ballot.svg"
        alt="" class="inlineimage">.</p>
    <p><img src="../settingspage-layouteditor.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>In this dialog you can select a file name for the layout you are going
      top modify. If currently a system layout was active (that you cannot
      change) a new user layout with the same name will be created and
      activated. If the layout already exists you can decide to overwrite it -
      or just choose a new name. You can still decide at the end of the editing
      process to discard your changes.</p>
    <p>After starting the layout editor you will have a red border at AvNav -
      and you can only see pages where you can adapt the layout on.</p>
    <img src="../mainpage-layout.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>By selecting a chart you can reach the navigation page as usual.</p>
    <p><img src="../navpage-layout.png" alt="" class="fimage"> </p>
    <p>All widgets are located in so called "panels". Within a panel you cand
      drag and drop the widgets as long as the editor mode is active (but you
      cannot move them from one panel to another one this way).</p>
    <p>On the navigation page you can assign different widgets to the panels
      depending on your display width. On a small display (value can be changed
      at Settings/small display) you can have different display then on a large
      one.</p>
    <p>Via <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/tune.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">you
      can bring up a dialog for configuring the panels on a page.</p>
    <img src="../navpage-layout-panels-marked.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>The available panels are marked at the picture. Within the dialog you can
      select which panels should be visible - deepending on the display mode
      (small/default). If there is a check in the "small" column it means that
      you will have a different set up for the small mode. In the example above
      the top panel is not visible in normal mode, the left panel has a
      different content in normal and small mode but the bottom panels have the
      same content both in normal and small mode. At "current conditions" you
      can select if you would like to edit the panels for normal or small mode.</p>
    <p>Both the bottom panels can have 2 rows of widgets (Setting: "2 widget
      rows") if there are widgets that do not fit any more the will be hidden
      completely.</p>
    <h2>Widget Dialog</h2>
    <p>After finishing the panel dialog you can now move the widgets within the
      panels or click on a widget or free space of a panel to bring up a widget
      dialog.</p>
    <img src="../navpage-layout-widget.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>Depending on the kind of widget the dialog will contain different
      settings. </p>
    <p>If you would like to move the widget to another panel you can select the
      target panel in the top most row of the dialog.</p>
    <p>With "Update" you will store your changes.</p>
    <p>At "New Widget" you can select a new widget from a list of available
      widgets.</p>
    <p>Each widget needs an information about the data it should display. All
      displayable data is internally available in a store and each item is
      addressed by a key.</p>
    <p>Depending on the type of widget the key(s) it will use to fetch the data
      from the store is fixed (i.e. built in) or has to be choosen in the
      dialog. The caption, unit and the css class can be set at most widgets.
      Assigning a css class is helpfull if you want to <a href="usercss.html">adapt
        the look and feel via css</a>).</p>
    <h2><a name="formatter" id="formatter"></a>Formatter</h2>
    <p>Most of the widgets need a formatter to convert the data from the
      internal format into the display format. In most cases the formatter being
      used by a widget is fixed. But some of the allow some parameters (comma
      separated list) that you can assign in this dialog - e.g. you can change
      formatSpeed to convert to m/s instead of kn).</p>
    <p>The list of formatters (and their parameters):</p>
    <table style="width: 100%" border="1">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Name</td>
          <td>Description</td>
          <td>Parameter</td>

            pa,hpa,bar</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Plugins or own extensions can potentially add more formatters.</p>
    <p>If you do not want to change the existing widget but add a new one - just
      use "Before" or "After" to insert it.</p>
    <p>If there are more parameters you will see them in the dialog.</p>
    <p><img src="../dashboard-3-layouit-widget.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>In the example a configuration for a graphics display (internally <a href="https://canvas-gauges.com/">canvas-gauges</a>
      is used).</p>
    <p>From the navigation page you can change toe the dashboard pages via the
      main page.</p>
    <h2>Dashboard Pages</h2>
    <p>You can configure up to 5 dashboard pages. On each of them you can have
      up to 5 panels.</p>
    <p>On an empty dahsboard page you have to start with the panel configuration
      - <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/tune.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">.</p>
    <p><img src="../dashboard-4-layout-panel.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>You can have different display if currently anchor watch is active (in
      the default layout this is used on page 1).</p>
    <p>If you have dahsboard pages without panels they will not appear in the
      display later on.</p>
    <p>In principle you can also adpat the display on the route editing page (<img
        src="../viewerimages/icons-new/route.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">from
      the navigation page) but the display for the currently editing route and
      for the list of waypoints has to stay visible there.</p>
    <p>When you are done with the layout editing you still need to save your
      layout using the button <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/ballot.svg" alt=""
        class="inlineimage">(red border) on each page.</p>
    <p><img src="../dashboard-layout-save.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>At this point you can still decide to discard all of your changes.</p>
    <p>When you save the layout it will immediately become active in your
      current browser (and will be stored at the server). Other browsers will
      only use the new layout if they reload the app or change the layout.</p>
    <h2>Layout Download/Upload</h2>
    <p>Via the Files/Download page <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/ic_file_download.svg"
        alt="" class="inlineimage">, subpage <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/ballot.svg"
        alt="" class="inlineimage"> you can download/upload/edit and delete the
      layout files. The currently active layout and system layouts can only be
      downloaded.</p>
    <p>If you are deleting a layout that is currently used within another
      browser and this browser reloads the app it will write this layout back to
      the server - so it will re-apply.</p>
    <h2>Special Widgets</h2>
    <p>Despite a long list of predefined widgets (like SOG, COG, BRG,
      AisTargetWidget,...) where you can only change the caption, unit,
      formatterParameters and css class there are a couple of special widgets.</p>
    <h3>Default</h3>
    <img src="../dashboard-3-layout-default.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>This widget internally is the basis for most of the simple display
      widgets. But you also use it to define some displays in the layout editor.</p>
    <p>In any case you need to select a value (the key for the store) and a
      formatter.</p>
    <p>When clicking on value you will be prompted with a list of available data
      for display.</p>
    <p><img src="../dashboard-3-layout-value.png" alt="" class="fimage"><br>
    </p>
    <p>First of all those are the values predefined internally in AvNav. If you
      have enabled the <a href="CanboatAndSignalk.html">signalk integration</a>
      you will also see all received values from signalk (below vessels/self)
      with a prefix nav.gps.signalk.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You have to take care to select a formatter that fits the value you
      selected.</p>
    <h3><a name="gauges" id="gauges"></a>Gauges</h3>
    <p>As already mentioned avnav integrates <a href="https://canvas-gauges.com/">canvas-gauges</a>.
      AvNav preconfigures a couple of widgets based on this library. Their
      parameters can be set in the layout editor.</p>
    <p>There are linear gauges (linGauge...) or radial gauges (radGauge...).<br>
      Via the layout editor only a couple of the possible parameters can be set
      directly.</p>
    <p>If you want more control or utilize different features of the canvas
      gauges library you should define own widgets as described in <a href="userjs.html">adapting
        with user specific java script code </a>.</p>
    <h3>SignalK</h3>
    <p>The signalk plugin also provides a couple of widgets - they especially
      contain formatters for values that are otherwise not included in AvNav
      like signalKCelsius for displaying temperatures in °C.</p>
    <p>They only make sense if you have appropriate signalk data, of course.</p>
    <h2>Adapting the Look and Feel of a Widget</h2>
    <p>If you would like to adapt the look and feel of a widget you should add
      an on css class to it. Afterwards you can assign rules to it in your <a href="usercss.html">user
        css</a>.</p>
    <h2>Own Widgets</h2>
    <p>With <a href="userjs.html">user defined Java Script Code</a> you can
      easily create your own widgets - both with simple HTML and with canvas
      based graphics.</p>
