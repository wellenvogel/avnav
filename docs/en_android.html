    <h1>AvNav Android</h1>
    <p>After having the <a href="beschreibung.html">AvNav web GUI for the
        Raspberry Pi</a>&nbsp; already in place for some years there is now also
      a pure android version. It needs android starting from 4.4.(KitKat).</p>
    <p>The most current version is available at <a href="../downloads/release/latest">downloads</a>
      . Alternatively in the&nbsp; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.wellenvogel.avnav.main">Play
        Store</a>.<br>
      Older versions or daily builds you can find via the&nbsp; <a href="install.html">installation
        instructions</a>.</p>
    <p>Basically the app is packaging the WebApp (see <a href="userdoc/index.html">User
        documentation</a>) into an android app. For Charts see the hints at <a
        href="charts.html">creating/converting charts</a>.</p>
    <p>The app can use the internal GPS of your device. Additionally you can
      receive NMEA data via TCP/IP, bluetooth or with an USB-serial adapter if
      your device supports USB OTG. As a sender for NMEA data you can e.g. use
      the raspberry version - or any other NMEA0183-wifi gateway. You can also
      use a simple bluetooth GPS mouse if your device does not have an internal
      GPS.</p>
    <p>Charts are primarily expected in gemf <a href="charts.html#chartformats">Format</a>.
      Since version 20200325 you can also use mbtiles or xml files for online
      chart sources. Charts can be located in 2 directories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> in the charts folder within the app working directory (choosen at
        start up). As this must be writable it will typically not be possible to
        put this on an SD card in newer android versions. </li>
      <li>in a freely selectable other directory (also on an SD card)
        "additional charts dir" in the settings<br>
        In the external charts dir you cannot directly use mbtiles. They must be
        copied into the working directory using <a href="userdoc/downloadpage.html">the
          app</a> .</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When starting up there are some demo online charts being available.</p>
    <p>If the choosen working directory is not yet there it will be created on
      first start up.(default: internal-sd-card/avnav).</p>
    <p>The track and log data will be written into the track directory below the
      working directory.</p>
    <p>In the routes sub folder the routes will be store in gpx format. Routes
      and tracks can be provided to other apps using the <a href="userdoc/downloadpage.html">download</a>
      function. To save them you need to have a file manager installed.</p>
    <p>After first start up you will see an introduction page:</p>
    <img alt="" src="android-start-first.png" height="400"><br>
    After clicking ok you will be on the main settings page.<br>
    <img src="android-mainsettings.png" alt="" class="fimage"><br>
    You can select the working directory and the external charts directory.
    Additionally you can select the sources for your NMEA data.<br>
    A complete list of settings you can find <a href="#Settings">here</a>.<br>
    <br>
    <p> You can leave the settings page with the upper right button or by
      pressing the back button. In normal mode you will reach the <a href="userdoc/mainpage.html">main
        page</a> of the app.</p>
    <img src="android-mainpage.png" alt="" class="fimage"><br>
    In the picture there is a valid internal position (green bubble) but
    currently no AIS data (red bubble).<br>
    To go back to the android setting move to the <a href="userdoc/settingspage.html">settings
      page</a> within the app and click the android button there.<br>
    On further starts you will directly start on the main page.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Bluetooth</h2>
    <br>
    To connect to a bluetooth device just pair it outside the app before
    starting AvNav.<br>
    Inside the app go to settings-&gt;bluetooth and select your device.<br>
    <br>
    To leave the app use the <img src="viewerimages/icons-new/ic_clear.svg" alt=""
      class="inlineimage">button on the main page. This will shut down the
    background service that is writing the track even if the app is in
    background otherwise.<br>
    <h2> Modes</h2>
    The app can run in 2 modes:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Normal</li>
      <li>External Browser</li>
    </ul>
    In the normal mode the browser is integrated in the app and it behaves like
    a normal android app.<br>
    In external browser mode the app starts up a web server an a port that you
    can&nbsp; select (default 34567) and shows the following page.<br>
    <img src="android-external.png" alt="" class="fimage"><br>
    <br>
    By clicking on "START BROWSER" you will be presented with a list of
    installed browsers and can select your favorite. I would recommend chrome.<br>
    Normally in the browser you will always have the address bar that wastes
    space. By using "add to home screen" in the settings you can put it on your
    start screen - and if you start from there it will run full screen.<br>
    <br>
    <img style="width: 640px; height: 400px;" alt="" src="android-chrome.png"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img style="width: 640px; height: 400px;" alt="" src="android-chrome2.png"><br>
    <br>
    To stop the app in this mode use the notification (sailboat) to go back to
    the app and leave it via "EXIT".<br>
    On the next start up only start the app and afterwards start your browser
    via the home screen icon.<br>
    <p> If you select Settings&gt;Android-&gt;MainSettings "WebServer external
      access" other devices in the same network can access your app.</p>
    <span style="color:red">Take care: Never use this in a publci network as
      there is no protection inside the app. Any user in the same network can
      access your device!</span><br>
    The app will annouce itself via bonjour as avnav-android so other devices
    can easily find it.<br>
    <br>
    When the app is running the track data will be written to a file every 5
    minutes.<br>
    Important Hint:<br>
    If you start up your browser once from the app and once from the home screen
    you will end up with different settings in the app.<br>
