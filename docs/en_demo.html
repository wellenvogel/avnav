      Demo
    </h1>
    <p>The demo shows you the main program functions.<br>
      You cannot store any data on the server - so e.g. the&nbsp; "connected"
      mode will not work. </p>
    <p>The charts are retrieved (online) from&nbsp; <a href="http://kartor.eniro.se/">http://kartor.eniro.se/</a>,
      from a "meshup" from BSH <a href="https://www.geoseaportal.de">https://www.geoseaportal.de</a>
      and from <a href="http://www.openseamap.org">http://www.openseamap.org/</a>
      (consider their copyrights).<br>
      BSH server are very slow - the display will be delayed.<br>
      The gps data is from a tour in 2013 from Klintholm to Vitte. They also
      include some AIS data.<br>
      The timeline for the data is somehow compressed - approximately double
      speed. If the demo reaches the end it will jump back to the beginning -
      this will lead to some strange track line. Just close your browser window
      and start over.</p>
    <p>As a starting point just click on the Boat button to lock the chart and
      start zooming in.<br>
      Continue playing...<br>
      Upload and download will not work in all browsers.</p>
