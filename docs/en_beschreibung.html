    <p>Important Hint:</p>
    <p><i><b>In no case I promise or can be held responsible for correct function
          of AvNav - especially using it for navigation is at your own risk.
          Before using it I recommend to carefully test the precision of the
          display and the used charts.</b></i></p>
    <h2 class="western">Motivation</h2>
    <p>After already navigating for some time with raster charts (first on
      Windows with Seaclear, later at Windows, WindowsCE and OSX with OpenCPN
      and OziExplorer) I was looking for options to extend this and make it
      better suite to my needs when being at sea.</p>
    <p>My wish list was:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Navigation on small devices (laptops always are slightly too bulky) – 7 or 10
          inch tablet would be perfect</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Navigation also in the cockpit</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Track storage</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Connection to "on board" electronics - I own a VHF that provides AIS
          data</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Usage of raster charts (BSB, NV, everything that can be downloaded
          using mobile atlas creator)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Minimized installation effort</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Small, low power consumption (should be possible to run it all the
          time)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Not too much manual work - avoid soldering own circuits</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>At some point in time I noticed the raspberry pi and felt it could become
      a perfect device for my needs.</p>
    <p>After some research (back in 2012...) I found that there was no ready to
      go solution that would perfectly fit my needs. Especially the handling of
      serial devices (typically USB-serial converters) is at least tricky
      most of the time on linux.</p>
    <p>So I started this project. I try to provide some description here for
      people that would like to use it. The software is available at an open
      source license (MIT). </p>
    <p><br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <h2 class="western">Overview</h2>
    <p><img class="fimage" src="overview.png" name="Grafik1" border="0" width="600"
        align="LEFT">avnav-raspi-2020<br clear="LEFT">
      The whole solution consists of different parts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A Raspberry Pi with the server software (avnav_server.py), that is
          reading the connected devices (NMEA via serial-USB converter – like PL
          2303), Bluetooth GPS, multiplexing and storing the data and providing
          them via WLAN</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A variant of this software for the desktop (Windows/OSx/Linux) for
          converting and preparing the charts</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The raspberry pi creates an access point and various devices can access
      its data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>There is some (other) navigation software running on the device
          (tested: InavX,OpenCPN), those access the NMEA data via TCP or UDP. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>On the client devices there is only a browser. All the navigation is handled
          by the AvNav WebApp that is downloaded from the raspi. There is no
          need for any other installed software on the device, only a current
          HTML5 browser (tested: Chrome Windows, OSX, Safari, Android starting
          4.4 – Chrome/Stock/Boat Browser, IOS, Blackberry stockBrowser,
          WebBrowser mini).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The server part is written in python and can be configured via an xml
      file. The normal set up is ready to go - i.e. there is no need for any
      configuration to get started. Beside the software itself there are images
      that you can download to get started - see <a href="install.html">installation</a>.</p>
    <p>The java script app provides all the basic navigation functions on raster
      charts (<a href="charts.html#chartformats">gemf,mbtiles</a>) or <a href="hints/ocharts.html">OESenc
        vector charts</a>&nbsp; including AIS display, waypoint navigation,
      routes, tracks,... The charts being used by the web app must be installed
      on the raspberry. </p>
    <p><a href="hints/ocharts.html">OESenc charts</a> can be bought in the <a href="https://www.o-charts.org/">o-charts</a>
      shop.</p>
    <p> If you have chart formats that cannot be handled directly in the app you
      have to <a href="charts.html">convert</a> them into gemf - using avnav at
      the desktop (or directly on the pi within the App). The converter can
      handle the following formats:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>All chart sources that can be read by <a href="https://gdal.org/">GDAL</a>
          software (especially BSB)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Charts downloaded with Mobile Atlas Creator</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Beside the described set up there is also an&nbsp; <a href="android.html">Android-App</a>
      that provides similar functions.The server part is implemented natively in
      Java, the display part is identical.</p>
    <p>The following chapters describe the parts a bit more in detail.</p>
    <h2 class="western">The Server Software (avnav_server.py)</h2>
    <p>The pi holds a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads">normal
        Debian image</a> (app. 2GB). Afterwards a couple of additional
      packages will be installed together with AvNav.</p>
    <p>The structure of the server software:</p>
    <p><img class="fimage" src="software.png" name="Grafik2" border="0" width="600">
    </p>
    <p>The server tries to detect all devices connected via USB-serial and via
      bluetooth-serial. You have to take care that your USB-serial device is
      correctly handled by the pi - like e.g. <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_VerifiedPeripherals#USB_UART_and_USB_to_Serial_.28RS-232.29_adapters">this
        one</a>. The server scans connected devices (via dbus) and discoveres
      the device nodes. Afterwards it tries to do some auto-bauding (i.e.
      determine the baudrate for the device) between 4800 and 34000 baud and
      tries to receive NMEA data. If no data is detected it starts over again by
      closing and reopening the devices. This way it can cope with disconnecting
      and reconnecting devices. I have connected a AIS VHF that gets GPS data
      from the pi and sends AIS data to it. If bluetooth serial devices are
      detected it will also try to read from them.</p>
    <p>You can also configure devices to output the data and this way have a NMEA
      multiplexer.</p>
    <p>All NMEA data internally are stored in a queue and are provided to
      outputs. By default a TCP socket is open that you can connect to (default
      port: 34567).</p>
    <p>Additionally you can configure more outputs (TCP,UDP,serial).</p>
    <p>Internally the data (including AIS) is also provided towards a decoder
      that will store them in the server software ("NMEA decoded data"). Those
      data is provided via an HTTP json API for the app. Additionally the server
      writes track data, computes routing information, handles anchor watch and
      alarms. </p>
    <p>For controlling an auto pilot the server computes RMB data and sends them
      to the internal queue so that it can be received by any connected device.<br>
    </p>
    If there is a valid time information in the GPS data it sets the system time
    of the raspberry.<br>
    <p>For automated start up there is a (systemd) service so you can control
      start and stop via systemctl.</p>
    <p> Most of the server functions you can configure via an xml file
      (avnav_server.xml). In the installed template there are examples for a
      couple of use cases already being included. Additionally (if a bluetooth
      device has been detected) AvNav tries to connect to bluetooths serial
      devices and receive NMEA data from them. </p>
    <p>Normally there is no need for additional configuration.</p>
    <p>You can find the software on <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav">github</a>

        description</a>.</p>

    <p>Except the systemd scripts (and some command scripts) the software is
      running with the user pi (on the raspberry). You can also start the
      software from the command line using the command "avnav". On a desktop
      system you can run this as any user.</p>
    <h2>The Web App</h2>
    The app is a single page app built with<span style="color: #0000ee;"> </span><a
      href="https://reactjs.org/">ReactJs</a>.<br>
    It communicates with the server using HTTP. The app entry point is <a href="http://avnav.avnav.de/viewer/avnav_viewer.html">http://avnav.avnav.de/viewer/avnav_viewer.html</a>.
    It is optimized for mobile devices - especially tablets starting at 7". But
    you can use it also on desktop systems or larger displays. Meaningful usage
    starts at around 900x540 pixel.<br>
