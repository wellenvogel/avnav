    <h1>AvNav Android</h1>
    <p>After having the <a href="../beschreibung.html">AvNav web GUI for the
        Raspberry Pi</a>&nbsp; already in place for some years, there is now
      also a genuine android version. It requires android 4.4 (KitKat) or later.</p>
    <p>The latest version is available at <a href="../../downloads/release/latest">downloads</a>.
      Alternatively in the&nbsp; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.wellenvogel.avnav.main">Play
        Store</a>.<br>
      You can find previous versions or daily builds via the&nbsp; <a href="../install.html">installation
        instructions</a>.</p>
    <p>Basically the app is packaging the WebApp (see <a href="../userdoc/index.html">User
        documentation</a>) into an android app. For Charts check the hints at <a
        href="../charts.html">creating/converting charts</a>.</p>
    <h2>Functions </h2>
    <p>(new since 20210424)</p>
    <p>Internally the app consists of a couple of functional entities.</p>
    <img src="software-android.png" alt="" class="fimage">
    <p>The NMEA multiplexer handles NMEA0183 data from various sources. Beside
      the internal GPS data can be read from sources like TCP connections, UDP
      ports, USB devices, Bluetooth... Most sources support sending and
      receiving of NMEA data at the same time. You can configure multiple
      sources of each type (within the app configuration there is a "handler"
      for each data source).</p>
    <table style="width: 100%" border="1">

        <tr>
          <td>TcpReader</td>
          <td>A TCP connection to an external system. AvNav acts as TCP client
            and will open up the connection.<br>
            You can either use a plain IP address or a hostname as destination
            (mdns names like avnav.local are supported).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>TcpWriter</td>
          <td>AvNav listens for connections from other apps or systems and sends
            out the NMEA data from the multiplexer. AvNav acts as TCP server.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>UdpReader</td>
          <td>AvNav receives UDP data at the configured port.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>UdpWriter</td>
          <td>AvNav sends out UDP data to the configured address and port.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>UsbConnection</td>
          <td>You can receive (and send) data via a connected USB serial
            converter device (requires USB OTG functionality of your Android
            device).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Bluetooth</td>
          <td>Connection to a bluetooth device. You need to pair the device
            (outside AvNav) before you can use it.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>NMEA0183 service</td>
          <td>A connection to a system the provides its NMEA data as a TCP
            service via mdns (Bonjour/<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avahi_%28Software%29">Avahi</a>)
            - like e.g. SignalK. <br>
            AvNav establishes a TCP connection to this device.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <br>
    <p>You can configure the NMEA multiplexer in a very flexible manner. For
      each connection you can define input and output filters or blacklists.</p>
    <p>Internally the multiplexer hands over its data to the other modules of
      the app. The decoder prepares the NMEA data for further usage inside the
      app.</p>
    <p>The app itself with the chart display and the dashboards can be used as a
      normal android app. Additionally you can activate the integrated web
      server. This allows access to all app functions from a browsers on the
      same or a different device (similar to the AvNav <a href="../beschreibung.html">server
        variant</a>).</p>
    <p>The display part of the app can be terminated while the multiplexer
      continues to run in background. So AvNav can act as a NMEA data provider
      for other navigation apps. You would configure a TcpWriter within AvNav
      and connect from the other app to localhost (127.0.0.1) and the configured
      port.</p>
    <h2></h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>The app can use the device's internal GPS. Additionally you can receive
      NMEA data via TCP/IP, bluetooth or by an USB-serial adapter if your device
      supports USB OTG. As a sender for NMEA data you can e.g. use the raspberry
      version - or any other NMEA0183-wifi gateway. You can also use a plain
      bluetooth GPS mouse if your device does not have an internal GPS.</p>
    <h2>Charts and stored Data</h2>
    <p><a name="workingdirectory" id="workingdirectory"></a>AvNav stores its
      data and charts in a working directory. You can choose between "internal
      storage" or "external storage" for this directory. Depending on the device
      the external storage <b>could</b> be located on the SD card. In any case
      other apps cannot access this directory.<br>
      So you have to load or export all data using the AvNav app itself.<br>
      There is only one exception: you can choose an "additonal chart directory"
      that can be used to store charts in gemf or xml format. This directory can
      be created and accessed outside AvNav.</p>
    <p>Charts are expected to be available in gemf- <a href="../charts.html#chartformats">Format</a>.
      Since 20200325 you can alos have "mbtiles" or "*.xml files". </p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Copy the charts either to the "additional charts dir" or <a href="../userdoc/downloadpage.html">upload
        them in the app</a> . Some demo charts are preinstalled - but they need
      an online connection.<br>
      To use o-charts (or S57 charts) you need to install <a href="../hints/ochartsng.html#android">avocharts</a>
      and install your charts there.</p>
    To save data from AvNav or upload data you should have a file manager
    installed (normally already available on most devices).
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>After first start up you will see an introduction page:</p>
    <img alt="" src="android-start-first.png" class="fimage"><br>
    After clicking ok you will see the main settings page.<br>
    <img src="android-settings-main.png" class="fimage"><br>
    Amongst other settings, you can select the working directory and the
    external charts directory. <br>
    A complete list of settings can be found <a href="#Settings">here</a>.<br>
    You can leave the settings page with the upper right button or by pressing
    the back button.<br>
    Each time you leave the settings page AvNav will check the permissions it
    expects and will ask you to allow them.<br>
    To work properly AvNav needs:
    <ul>
      <li>Access to fine location (GPS) as long as the app is running</li>
      <li>Notifications to show you an info as long as AvNav is running (even
        when in background)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally AvNav will check if energy saving is enabled. If enabled
      AvNav will not be able to use the internal GPS while in background. So you
      will be asked to disable it.</p>
    <p>Afterwards yo will get to the <a href="../userdoc/mainpage.html">main
        page</a> of the app (typically you will be prompted to accept the
      conditions before and to select one of the available layouts).</p>
    <img src="android-mainpage.png" alt="" class="fimage"><br>
    In the screenshot a valid internal position is shown (green bubble), but
    currently no AIS data (yellow bubble).<br>
    To return to the android setting move to the <a href="../userdoc/settingspage.html">settings
      page</a> within the app and click the android button there.<br>
    On further starts,&nbsp; the app will directly present the main page.<br>
    For further usage description refer to the <a href="../userdoc/mainpage.html">WebApp
      description</a>.<br>
    <p> </p>
    <br>
    <h2>External Access</h2>
    <p> (new since 20210424).</p>
    <p>AvNav supports being accessed from other devices using a web browser. To
      provide this function you need to enable the WebServer in the settings of
      the app (<a href="../userdoc/statuspage.html">Status/Server Page</a> <img
        src="../viewerimages/icons-new/status.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">).<br>
      You need to switch on "externalAccess" (only do this in trusted networks).
      With 'mdnsEnabled' a bonjour enabled app (like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.wellenvogel.bonjourbrowser">BonjourBrowser</a>)
      can directly connect to the server.</p>
    <p>In previous versions AvNav was using different modes for that.<span style="color: #cccccc;"><br>
      </span></p>
    <span style="color: #cccccc;"> </span>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="color: #cccccc;">Normal</span></li>
      <li><span style="color: #cccccc;">External Browser</span></li>
    </ul>
    <span style="color: #cccccc;">In normal mode the browser is integrated and
      it behaves like a standard android app.<br>
      In external browser mode the app starts up a web server at a user
      definable port (default 34567). </span><br>
    <br>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The NMEA multiplexer (and the Web Server) of AvNav can run in background.
      You would e.g. use this if your display is on a different device.<br>
      To enter the background mode open the close dialog on the main page <img
        src="../viewerimages/icons-new/ic_clear.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">and
      select "BACKGROUND".<br>
      Via the android notification (in the Android notification bar) you can
      bring back the app to foreground - or close it completely.</p>
    <br>
    <h2> <a id="Settings" name="Settings"></a>Settings</h2>
    <p>The settings are split into two separate categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Specific Android settings</li>
      <li>Settings for the multiplexer and other main parts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The android settings can be accessed via the <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/ic_android.svg"
        alt="" class="inlineimage">button on the <a href="../userdoc/settingspage.html">settings
        page</a> or on the&nbsp; <a href="../userdoc/statuspage.html">server/status</a>

        Page</a> <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/status.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">.
      For each function (e.g. for each data source of the multiplexer) a so
      called 'handler' is available. You can check the status of the handlers
      and change their configuration.</p>
    <p>New data sources (or targets) can be added using the <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/ic_add.svg"
        alt="" class="inlineimage">button. A select dialog will provide all

    <h4>NMEA0183 Service</h4>
    <p>A NMEA0183 service mainly works like a TcpReader, without the need to
      define IP address and port of the origin. Instead you select the name of a
      MDNS service providing NMEA data from a list of detected services
      (type:&nbsp; _nmea-0183._tcp). If there is e.g. a SignalK server or an
      AvNav server (&gt; 20210415) in your network - they will announce their
      services this way (if configured to do so).</p>
    <p>Advantage of using a service: it will continue to work if you change your
      network topology.</p>

      configuration dialog for the newly connected device.</p>
