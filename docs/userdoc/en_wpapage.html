    <h1> The Wifi Configuration Page</h1>
    <p>- not on android -</p>
    <p>From the <a href="statuspage.html">status page</a> you get here using
      the <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/ic_rss_feed.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">button.</p>
    <p><img src="../wpapage.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>This page will only be shown if the wifi client handling is configured
      and a wifi adapter is plugged into the correct USB port.</p>
    <p><img src="../raspi3-wlan.jpg" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>In the picture a Raspberry Pi 3 is shown, For newer ones with blue USB3.0
      sockets you must connect to the blue socket that is closed to the pcb.</p>
    <p>On the OS level on the pi a network interface "wlan-av1" must be shown.
      In the configuration (avnav_server.xml) an entry</p>
    <div class="code">&lt;AVNWpaHandler wpaSocket="/var/run/wpa_supplicant/wlan-av1"&gt;
&lt;/AVNWpaHandler&gt;</div>
    <p>must exist.</p>
    <p>On the page all wifi networks in range and the configured networks are
      shown.<br>
      By clicking on an entry you can connect to this network.</p>
    <p><img src="../wpa-connect.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>If you would like to allow an access from this network to your rasp you
      must switch on "external access".</p>
    <p><b>Warning: Never enable external access in a public wifi network! There
        is no protection in AvNav and anybody within the same network could
        access your system.</b> <br>
      But you can use it if you e.g. use an own LTE router and would like to
      allow your devices connected to this router to access AvNav.</p>
    <p>If the connection has been established it will be shown and the network
      will have a grey background in the lsist.</p>
    <p><img src="../wpapage-connected.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>During connection set up some status information will be visible close to
      "Interface".</p>
    <p>If you would like to disconnect you can click again on the network and
      can disable it or remove it from the configuration completely.</p>
    <p><img src="../wpapage-modify.png" alt="" class="fimage"></p>
    <p>All the wifi information is stored in the file
      /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf.</p>
