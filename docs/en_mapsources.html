    <p>Some minor modifications to make access to BSH servers working again.</p>
    <h2>Sources</h2>
    <p>For the <a href="https://mobac.sourceforge.io/">Mobile Atlas Creator</a>
      I created a coupl of map sources that will give you more control when
      accessing online map source with some xml config. You need to unpack the
      file <a href="../downloads/avnav-mapsources.zip">avnav-mapsources.zip</a>
      within the directory "mapsources" of the Mobile Atlas Creator.</p>
    <p>You will get (among others) a "mashUp" with BSH chart services (see <a href="../../bshviewer/bshviewer.html">bsh-viewer</a>)
      and OpenSeaMap ("BSH OpenSeaMap 2014 Extended"). Additionally BSH allone
      ("BSH 2014 Extended") or OpenSeaMap + OpenStreetMap ("OWS OpenSeaMap
      2014").</p>
    <p>If you want to change - just adapt the .exml files. For the BSH layers
      you can try them with my <a href="../../bshviewer/bshviewer.html">
        bsh-viewer</a> (just edit the sources on the right side). Additionally
      you can adapt the colors (I tried to get some more contrast). To change
      the color mappings you can open one of the tiles with a painting program
      and pick up the hex values for the colors you would like to change. Those
      must be adapted inside the .exml files.</p>
    <p>Typically the download will run for a long time - the BSH servers are
      slow. If the download stoips, just try again in MOBAC. Set the cache to a
      sufficient time (e.g. one month). Always use "OsmdroidGEMF" as atlas
      format.</p>
    <p>If you apply changes to the .exml files you need to delete the databases
      for this chartsource (below tilestore) and restart MOBAC.</p>
    <p>Source files on <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav/tree/master/mobac/testsrc">github</a>.</p>
    <p>The result could look like...(entrance to Greifswald):</p>

    <p>The download:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="../downloads/avnav-mapsources.zip">avnav-mapsources.zip</a>
        (Mapsources BSH, BSH+OpenSeaMap)</li>
    </ul>
