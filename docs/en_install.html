    <h2> Releases </h2>
    <p>A description of the releases and links to downloads can be found in the
      <a href="release.html">releases document</a>.</p>
    <h2 class="western"><a name="Headless"></a>Image wihout attached
      display(Headless)</h2>
    <p>Those images are maintained by <a href="https://www.segeln-forum.de/user/27970-blacksea/">BlackSea</a>
      (many thanks...). A description is available on<a href="https://github.com/free-x/avnav/wiki">
        his page</a>. </p>
    <p>For this image just download it from&nbsp; <a href="https://www.free-x.de/raspbian/buster/">free-x</a>
      and put it on a SD card like described at <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads">http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads</a>
      (raw images). Afterwards you could login to the pi once to potentially
      adapt some system settings. The simplest approach is to hook your pi to
      your home network and ask your router for the address of the pi. You could
      also try a broadcast ping from your desktop like&nbsp; ping -b
      &lt;brodcast-address&gt; . You could also connect a keyboard and screen to
      your pi, of course.</p>
    <p>All passwords are set to default values.login pi, password raspberry. You
      can get a root shell with sudo -i. You should change the passowrd for the
      pi user (passwd). The image will set up a wifi access point with the SSID
      avnav using the internal wifi adapter.<br>
      This network will have the address range 192.168.20.0/24. The pi itself
      has the address 192.168.20.10 - use this as url in the browser if nothing
      else works. There is a DHCP server and a DNS server (dnsmasqd). You can
      adapt the configuration in /etc/dnsmasqd.conf. If the pi is connected to a
      wired network it tries to get an ip via DHCP. It has NAT forwarding from
      it's wifi to the wired network. This way you can easily connect to the
      internet.<br>
      If you connect further wifi sticks, more access points will be created.<br>
      Exception: wifi stick like in the picture (on newer Pi4 use the blue
      socket close to the PCB) - this will become a client network, internal
      name wlan-av1. You can configure client access via <a href="userdoc/wpapage.html">the
        app</a>. </p>
    <img class="fimage" src="raspi3-wlan.jpg">
    <p>Port 80 is forwarded to the listener port of AvNav (8080) but only for
      the wifi network.<br>
      If everything is set up correctly you can reach the WebApp at <a href="http://avnav/">http://avnav.avnav.de</a>.<br>
      Avnav is announcing a bonjour service (avnav) - with an appropriate app (<a
        href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.wellenvogel.bonjourbrowser">Android</a>,
      <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bonjour-search-for-http-web-in-wi-fi/id1097517829">IOS</a>)
      you can reach the server without any address input.<br>
      If you have a wifi client connection the wifi is forwarding traffic there
      via NAT. This way internet connectivity will be available for connected
      devices.<br>
      You can check the status/start/stop with </p>
    <div class="code">sudo systemctl status avnav
sudo systemctl start avnav 
sudo systemctl stop avnav</div>
    <p> </p>
    <h2 class="western"><a name="Touch"></a>Image with Display (avnav-touch)</h2>
    <span>If you would like to directly connect a display to your pi thsi image
      is for you. </span>Holger (<a href="https://www.segeln-forum.de/user/13545-pandel/">pandel</a>)
    is maintaining an own image line for this set up. Great documentation is
    available at his <a href="https://open-mind.space/">AvNav-Touch page</a>.
    Download is possible from the <a href="https://open-mind.space/download/">download
      page</a>.<br>
    You still will be able to connect further external displays.<br>
    <b>Important Hint</b>: <span style="color: red;">Currently (12/2020) those
      images are outdated. You would need to set up the package repository
      described in the next chapter and update the packages from there. We are
      working on an update.</span><br>
    <h2 class="western"><a name="Packages"></a>Package Installation</h2>
    Thanks to Oleg&nbsp; there are ready to go package repositories that you can
    use in your debian based system. This will work on the pi as well as on any
    other debian (like ubuntu).<br>
    Information is available at his <a href="https://github.com/free-x/avnav/wiki">description</a>.
    <p>To set up the repository on your system run the following commands (only
      necessary if you do not use the headless or the avnav touch images):</p>
    <div class="code">sudo date -s "2020/12/03 14:30" <br>wget https://www.free-x.de/debian/oss.boating.gpg.key
sudo apt-key add oss.boating.gpg.key
wget https://www.free-x.de/debian/boating.list
sudo cp boating.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/<br>sudo apt-get update</div>
    <p>The first line (date -s...) is only necessary if you start e.g. with the
      headless images or other images that do not have a time synchronization
      active. Adapt the date and time to your current time.<br>
    </p>
    <p>For installing packages on a raspberry you need the run the following
      command after setting up the package repository:</p>
    <div class="code">sudo apt-get install avnav avnav-raspi</div>
    The raspberry will start avnav with the user pi.<br>
    <br>
    For a different debian or if you do not want the configuration from AvNav
    for your operating system you would just execute:<br>
    <div class="code">sudo apt-get install avnav</div>
    Afterwards you can start AvNav as any user with <br>
    <div class="code">avnav</div>
    <br>
    With <br>
    <div class="code">sudo systemctl enable avnav
sudo systemctl start avnav</div>
    you can enable avnav to start with the user avnav on system reboot.<br>
    Alternatively you can download all packages from my download pages:<br>
    <ul>
      <li><a title="downloads/releases" href="../downloads/release">Releases</a></li>
      <li><a href="../downloads/daily">Daily Builds</a></li>
    </ul>
    After downloading you can install them<br>
    <div class="code">sudo dpkg -i avnav_xxxxxxxx_all,deb
sudo dpkg -i avnav-raspi_xxxxxxxx_all.deb
sudo apt-get -f</div>
    (only use the&nbsp; -raspi... package on a rasberry pi).The first commands
    will complain about missing dependencies, the last one should fix this.<br>
    <p> If you install on a pi you should only use the avnav-raspi package if it
      is ok to you to change your network set up to the AvNav defaults.
      Otherwise only install the basic avnav package.</p>
    <p>I would also recommend to install the <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav-update-plugin">AvNav
        Update plugin</a> - either from the package repositories with</p>
    <div class="code">sudo apt-get install avnav-update-plugin</div>
    <p>Or by downloading it directly from <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav-update-plugin">GitHub.</a></p>
    <p>If you do not install the avnav-raspi package you need some additional
      steps to automatically start up AvNav:</p>
    You could start up avnav as user pi from the command line with avnav.<br>
    If you would like to run it as a system service you need to create the
    directory:<br>
    /usr/lib/systemd/system/avnav.service.d<br>
    and copy the file <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav/blob/master/raspberry/raspberry.conf">raspberry.conf</a>
    there.<br>
    Afterwards you still need to change the line 5 in this file as you do not
    have the rasperry specific template. Change it to:<br>
    <br>
    <div class="code"><span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 46); font-family: SFMono-Regular, Consolas, &quot;Liberation Mono&quot;, Menlo, monospace; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;">ExecStart=/usr/bin/avnav -q -b /home/pi/avnav/data -t /usr/lib/avnav/avnav_template.xml</span></div>
    Afterwards you can enable and start avnav as system service with<br>
    <div class="code">sudo systemctl daemon-reload<br>sudo systemctl enable avnav<br>sudo systemctl start avnv</div>
    <p>If you did not create/copy the file avnav will run with the user avnav.</p>
    <p>If you want a small GUI for the chart conversion on your desktop you need
      to install the package python-wxgtk3.0. You can bring up the GUI with</p>
    <div class="code">avnav -g</div>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>OpenPlotter</h2>
    <p>For <a href="https://openmarine.net/openplotter">OpenPlotter</a> we have
      a complete integration for AvNav (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/e-sailing">e-sailing</a>).
      In the repository <a href="https://www.free-x.de/deb4op/">https://www.free-x.de/deb4op/</a>
      (that is already active in OpenPlotter) the necessary packages are already
      available. So you can install them simply with</p>
    <div class="code">sudo apt update
sudo apt install openplotter-avnav</div>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Do not install avnav-raspi_xxx.deb on OpenPlotter as this will interfere
      with the OpenPlotter network configuration. Within the OpenPlotter AvNav
      configuration you can change the port for AvNav (default 8080 and 8082 for
      ocharts) if this interferes with other applications.</p>
    <p>When you install AvNav this way it will receive all NMEA data from
      SignalK (and will not open up USB devices by its own). So you can make any
      interface configuration changes in OpenPlotter or SignalK.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="Windows"></a>Windows</h2>
    For windows there is an installer. This installer will not be updated on
    every release. The current version is <a href="../downloads/latestwindows">here</a>.<br>
    I recommend to use the AvNavNetSetup-jjjj-mm-dd-0.exe installer as this one
    will download the AvNav software directly and is able to update it without a
    new installer.<br>
    The windows version is focusing on <a href="charts.html#windows">chart
      conversion</a> but has the complete functionality. You can connect further
    displays.<br>
