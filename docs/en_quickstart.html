    <h1>AvNav Quickstart</h1>
    <p class="western">Important Hint: <i><b>In no case I promise or can be
          held responsible for correct function of AvNav&nbsp; - especially
          using it for navigation is at your own risk. Before using it I
          recommend to carefully test the precision of the display and the used
          charts.</b></i></p>
    <div class="toc"></div>
    <p class="western">A detailed description of the concepts can be found in
      the chapter <a href="beschreibung.html">introduction</a>.</p>
    <h2 class="western">General</h2>
    <p>AvNav has been designed to be usable on touch devices (also with
      relatively small screens). The idea was to allow ease of use also under
      restricted "on board" conditions.</p>
    <p>Of course you can operate AvNav by mouse and keyboard as well.</p>
    <h2 class="western">Installation and Set Up</h2>
    <p>AvNav is available in 2 variants:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Client-Server<br>
        The server will be installed onto a Linux or Windows system (like a
        Raspberry Pi). As "client" you will use an arbitrary browser to interact
        with the system (e.g. on a tablet or smart phone)</li>
      <li>Android App<br>
        The complete functionality is bundled within the app. Additional client
        devices can connect with a browser.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Client Server</h3>
    <p>AvNav is available as <a href="install.html#Packages">package for
        various Linux distributions</a> (Debian packages, Rpm) and as a <a href="install.html#Windows">Windows
        installer</a>.<br>
      The Debian packages are hosted in a <a href="https://github.com/free-x/avnav/wiki">repository</a>
      but they can be downloaded from the <a href="release.html">release page</a>
      as well.<br>
      Additionally we maintain <a href="install.html#Headless">images for the
        Raspberry Pi</a>. A detailed documentation is available in the chapter <a
        href="install.html">installation</a>.</p>
    <p>After installing and starting up you can use your browser to connect to
      AvNav and open the <a href="userdoc/index.html">WebApp</a>.<br>
      If you are using our images the raspberry will establish a Wifi network
      (name and password can be adapted). For details on how to connect to your
      server refer to the <a href="install.html#connecting">image documentation</a>.
      <br>
      If you are connected to the server differently you can adress
      http://avnav.local:8080 (does not work on android) - or you can use the IP
      of the server.<br>
      For IOS and Android devices I would recommend using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_%28software%29">Bonjour</a>
      Browser. This tool can find the AvNav servers in the local network and
      will start a browser without the need of entering an address.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>IOS: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bonjour-search-for-http-web-in-wi-fi/id1097517829?mt=8"><img
            class="inlineimage" src="https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple69/v4/ba/f9/c2/baf9c2dd-656d-c303-fae1-a07310825e72/pr_source.png/246x0w.png"></a></li>
      <li>Android: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.wellenvogel.bonjourbrowser"><img
            src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sOV0YDqS3VNhTd4PfLB4PKj89_bbP8MtFHCVydjSp1-zLMyc8LB_z_HFVsZQEFgINQ=s180-rw"
            alt="" class="inlineimage"></a> </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Android App</h3>
    <p>The <a href="android/android.html">App</a> is available in the Play
      Store <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.wellenvogel.avnav.main"><img
          src="sailboat512r.png" alt="" class="inlineimage"> </a></p>
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>After installing AvNav (or when using a ready to go image) you can
      normally start without any additional configuration. AvNav will scan USB
      interfaces for serial adapters and will try to determine the appropriate
      baud rate. Depending on the kind of installation a udp receiver is active
      on port 34667.</p>
    <p>To adapt the AvNav server configuration you can use the <a href="userdoc/statuspage.html">server/status
        page</a>. Additionally you can adapt the look and feel with <a href="userdoc/settingspage.html">settings</a>,
      <a href="hints/layouts.html">layout adaptation</a> and with <a href="hints/userjs.html">user
        defined code</a>/<a href="hints/usercss.html">CSS</a> and <a href="hints/plugins.html">plugins</a>.</p>
    <p>With the Android installation, all settings are directly integrated in
      the App.</p>
    <h2>NMEA Data</h2>
    <p><img class="fimage" src="en_avnav_schnittstellen.png" border="0" width="600">
    </p>
    <h3>Client Server</h3>
    <p>AvNav processes NMEA0183 Data from connected USB devices, serial ports,
      bluetooth devices, TCP (client and server) or UDP. A NMEA multiplexer is
      integrated allowing for flexible <a href="hints/configfile.html">configuration</a>
      of the flow of received and sent data.</p>
    <p>A couple of NMEA sentences are decoded within AvNav (position data,
      AIS,...) and used for it's display and routing functions.</p>
    <p>In combination with <a href="hints/CanboatAndSignalk.html">Canboat and
        SignalK</a> you can also handle <a href="hints/CanboatAndSignalk.html">NMEA2000</a>
      data. Additionally you can use all your own vessel's SignalK data to be
      displayed within AvNav.</p>
    <p><a name="decoding"></a>The following NMEA sentences are decoded:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>!AIVDM</li>
      <li>$xxGGA</li>
      <li>$xxGSV</li>
      <li>$xxGLL</li>
      <li>$xxVTG</li>
      <li>$xxRMC (mag. variation since 20240520)</li>
      <li>$xxMWV (since 20220225 added waterSpeed)</li>
      <li>$xxDPT</li>
      <li>$xxDBT</li>
      <li>$xxXDR (since 20210114)</li>
      <li>$xxHDG (since 210106xx , mag. variation since 20240520)</li>
      <li>$xxHDT (since 20210619)</li>
      <li>$xxHDM (since 20210619) <br>
      </li>
      <li>$xxVHW partial (since 20210619)</li>
      <li>$xxVWR (since 20220225)</li>
      <li>$xxMTW (since 20220225)</li>
      <li>$xxZDA (since 20220421)</li>
      <li>$xxVDR (since 20240520)</li>
    </ul>
    &nbsp; Depending on the <a href="hints/configfile.html">configuration</a>
    AvNav is able to generate following NMEA sentences:
    <ul>
      <li>$GPRMB</li>
      <li>$GPAPB</li>
      <li>$AVXDR</li>
      <li>$AVMDA</li>
      <li>$AVMTA</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In combination with <a href="hints/CanboatAndSignalk.html">Canboat and
        SignalK</a> NMEA2000 data can be received and processed too. All own
      vessel data available in SignalK can be displayed in AvNav.<br>
      Since 20220421 AvNav can directly receive it's navigation data from
      SignalK.</p>
    <h3>Android</h3>
    <p>On <a href="android/android.html">Android</a> you can utilize the
      internal GPS. Additionally you can have a TCP or bluetooth connection for
      receiving GPS or AIS data. If your Android device has USB-OTG available
      you can connect an USB-serial adapter as well.</p>
    <p>The following NMEA sentences will be decoded:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>!AIVDM</li>
      <li>$xxGGA</li>
      <li>$xxGSV</li>
      <li>$xxGLL</li>
      <li>$xxGSA</li>
      <li>$xxRMC</li>
      <li>$xxMWV (since 20220225 added&nbsp; waterSpeed)</li>
      <li>$xxDBT</li>
      <li>$xxXDR (since 20210114)</li>
      <li>$xxHDG (since 210106xx, mag. variation since 20240520)</li>
      <li>$xxHDT (since 20210619)</li>
      <li>$xxHDM (since 20210619) <br>
      </li>
      <li>$xxVHW partial (since 20210619)</li>
      <li>$xxVWR (since 20220225)</li>
      <li>$xxMTW (since 20220225)</li>
      <li>$xxVDR (since 20240520)</li>
    </ul>
    AvNav is able to create and send out $GPRMC and $GPRMB (since 20220225 also
    $GPAPB) if configured.<br>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Charts</h2>
    <p>AvNav generally handles <a href="charts.html#Intro">raster charts</a>.
      You can download them from various internet sources (e.g. <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/DE:Locus#https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/DE:Locus#Offline-Karten">OpenSeaMap</a>
      or <a href="https://tileservice.charts.noaa.gov/tileset.html#50000_1-locator">NOAA</a>)
      - or you can use software like <a href="https://mobac.sourceforge.io/">MobileAtlasCreator</a>&nbsp;
      or <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/SAS_Planet">SASPlanet</a>
      to download/create charts.</p>
    <p>AvNav can directly process charts in <a href="charts.html#chartformats">gemf
        and mbtiles formats</a>. Additionally you can <a href="charts.html#Convert">convert</a>
      other types of raster charts like BSB (kap). This can be done directly on
      the server (raspberry) - or better beforehand on a desktop system.</p>
    <p>Additionally AvNav can process oeSENCcharts from <a href="hints/ocharts.html">o-charts</a>
      - on Android with <a href="hints/ochartsng.html">the avocharts app
        (ochartsng</a>). The company offers charts for Open Source Software at
      reasonable prices.</p>
    <p>With the <a href="hints/ochartsng.html">ochartsng</a> plugin AvNav can
      also display free S57 charts (after conversion).</p>
    <p>Charts need to be uploaded to AvNav before being usable - at the&nbsp; <a
        href="userdoc/downloadpage.html">Files/Download page</a>, section charts
      <img src="viewerimages/icons-new/map2.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">.
      o-charts must be uploaded via the <a href="hints/ocharts.html">o-charts
        plugin</a> / <a href="hints/ochartsng.html">ochartsng plugin</a></p>
    <p>Using the <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav-mapproxy-plugin">mapproxy-plugin</a>
      AvNav can include various online chart sources. Areas of those charts can
      be downloaded with the plugin for offline usage.</p>
    <p>More details in the chapter <a href="charts.html">charts</a>.</p>
    <h2>Displays</h2>
    <p>At the <a href="userdoc/navpage.html">Navigation page</a> the boat
      position, it's course, the route to the next waypoint, the current route,
      AIS targets and their courses, navigation circels and defined <a href="hints/overlays.html">overlays</a>
      will be shown on the chart.</p>
    <p>At the <a href="userdoc/navpage.html">Navigation page</a>, inside the <a
        href="userdoc/editroutepage.html">Route Editor</a> and at up to 5 <a href="userdoc/dashboardpage.html">Dashboard
        pages</a> you can display the values of all available navigational data.
      These include values from <a href="hints/CanboatAndSignalk.html">SignalK</a>.</p>
    <p>You can use simple numeric displays,<a href="hints/layouts.html#gauges">
        analog gauges</a> or graphical displays.</p>
    <p>The displays can be adapted to your preferences. There is a <a href="hints/layouts.html">Layout
        Editor</a> and you can create / modify displays with some lines of <a href="hints/userjs.html">Java
        Script Code</a> and <a href="hints/usercss.html">CSS</a>.</p>
    <p>You can define different sets of display "layouts" and store them on the
      AvNav server. For each display device you can select the set ("layout")
      that you would like to use.</p>
    <p>There is also an adaptation to different screen sizes available in the
      layout ("small").</p>
    <h2><a name="routes"></a>Routes</h2>
    <p>You can easily create and edit routes within AvNav. You will use the
      chart view at the <a href="userdoc/editroutepage.html">Route Editor</a>.
      Normally you just drag the center of the chart (cross) to the next point
      you would like to add. With a button click you add this to the route. You
      can easily move, edit or delete points within the route.</p>
    <p>Waypoints or other routes that are shown as <a href="hints/overlays.html">overlays</a>
      can be added to the route.</p>
    <p>You can invert the route or empty it. Within AvNav routes are stored as
      gpx files. You can export or import them at the <a href="userdoc/downloadpage.html">Files/Download
        page</a>. From within the Route Editor you can immediately start the
      route navigation. When following a route an alarm will be raised as you
      reach the next waypoint (if you are within an "approach" distance) and
      AvNav will automatically switch to the next waypoint.</p>
    <p>Since version 20220819 AvNav can handle two different routing modes. <a
        name="RoutingMode"></a></p>
    <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle">great circle</a></h3>
    A route is computed as the shortest distance between two points on the
    earth. The drawback is a course that will change permanently throughout the
    route. In the map display this route will be a curve.<br>
    In older versions AvNav always computed routes as great circle - by
    accidently did draw them as straight lines.<br>
    For shorter distances (&lt; 100nm) this basically does not matter at all.
    <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhumb_line">rhumb line</a></h3>
    A route will be computed for a constant course. The display on the map will
    be a straight line.
    <p>To switch the modes use the Router at the <img src="viewerimages/icons-new/status.svg"
        alt="" class="inlineimage"> <a href="userdoc/settingspage.html">server/status
        page</a>. For the <img src="viewerimages/icons-new/straighten.svg" alt=""
        class="inlineimage"> measure tool you can set the mode separately in the
      settings of the App (at Navigation/Measure Display RhumbLine). This way
      you can easily compare the two pathes.</p>
    <h3><a name="nextwp"></a>Next Waypoint Switching</h3>
    <p>To trigger the automatic switch to the next waypoint two conditions must
      be meat simultaneously:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The boot must be located inside the approach radius of the waypoint
        (can be defined in the app settings before you start a route). This will
        become visible by a red display of the Route Widget and the triggering
        of the waypoint alarm.</li>
      <li>Depending on the selected mode (Router on the <img src="viewerimages/icons-new/status.svg"
          alt="" class="inlineimage"> <a href="userdoc/settingspage.html">server/status
          page</a>: nextWpMode) - new since 20220819<br>
        "late" (the default and the one used in older versions): The distance to
        the current waypoint must not decrease any more and the distance to the
        next waypoint must start to decrease.<br>
        "90": The waypoint is "abeam" - more exactly the boat has crossed a line
        +/- 90° to the original waypoint course.<br>
        "early": The switch will be triggered by a delay (that you can
        configure) after the waypoint alarm has been initiated (without any
        further conditions).</li>
    </ol>
    It is important to know the the automatic switch will only occur if really
    both conditions are meat. If you would like to trigger the switch by hand
    you can bring up the waypoint buttons by a click on the lower left widgets
    and use the <img src="viewerimages/icons-new/nextwp.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">Button.
    <p></p>
    <h2><a name="tracks"></a>Tracks</h2>
    <p>AvNav is records the current track displaying it on the chart. To
      minimize the number of trackpoints they will just be recorded after major
      changes of position or after a given time interval (see <a href="hints/configfile.html?lang=en#h3:AVNTrackWriter">Configuration
        ANVTrackWriter</a>). The tracks will be output as gpx file at regular
      intervals. They can be exported and imported at the <a href="userdoc/downloadpage.html#tracks">Files/Download
        page</a> (on that page you can also see their metadata like length and
      time). Every day a separate gpx file is created. Available tracks can be
      displayed as <a href="hints/overlays.html">overlay</a> on the chart.</p>
    <p>You can as well&nbsp; <a href="hints/TracksToRoutes.html">convert a
        track into a route</a>. There is some program logic implemented to
      reduce the number of points.</p>
    <h2><a name="AIS"></a>AIS</h2>
    <p>On your chart there will be a display of the AIS targets within a defined
      range (default: 20nm) with their positions and courses. CPA (closest point
      of approach) of AIS targets will be computed and a warning issued if a
      defined minimum distance is not kept.</p>
    For details refer to the <a href="userdoc/navpage.html#ais">navigation page</a>.<br>
    <h2>Alarm</h2>
    <p>AvNav can trigger alarms for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Anchor Watch<br>
        On the <a href="userdoc/dashboardpage.html#anchorwatch">Dashboard pages</a>
        you can activate the anchor watch. Depending on the layout, the displays
        will change. Whenever your boat leaves the defined circle or if the gps
        signal is lost, an alarm will be issued.</li>
      <li>Approaching the next waypoint</li>
      <li>Man over Board<br>
        On all pages there is a separate <img src="viewerimages/icons-new/drowning.svg"
          alt="" class="inlineimage"> <a href="userdoc/mainpage.html#mob">Man-over-board
          button</a>. By clicking this button the current position will set as
        routing target, all other routings will be stopped. Additionally the
        alarm is set.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All alarms will be handled on the AvNav server. So you may switch off all
      display devices, still any alarm handling (like e.g. anchor watch) will
      continue to work.</p>
    <p>You can assign a sound (both at the server and at display devices) to the
      alarm. At the server you can trigger definable commands whenever an alarm
      is raised (see <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav/tree/master/hardware/simple-pi">example</a>).
      The configuration is handled within the <a href="hints/configfile.html#AVNAlarmHandler">configfile
        - AVNAlarmHandler</a>.</p>
    <h2>Nightmode</h2>
    <p>At the <a href="userdoc/mainpage.html">Main page</a> you can active the
      night mode <img src="viewerimages/icons-new/night.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">.
      All pages will be adapted accordingly.</p>
    <h2>Remote Control</h2>
    <p>AvNav is able to control display functions on one device from another one
      - or from the server. For details refer to the <a href="hints/RemoteControl.html">description</a>
      .</p>
    <h2></h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Adaptations</h2>
    <p>You can adapt AvNav to your personal needs by various means. As all pages
      are handled within a browser you can use <a href="hints/usercss.html">CSS</a>
      to customize your display.</p>
    <p>The server configuration is defined by the file <a href="hints/configfile.html">avnav_server.xml</a>.
      Typically there is no need for editing this file directly. Instead you
      should use the <a href="userdoc/statuspage.html">server/status page</a>
      to change the settings.</p>
    <p>Beside adapting the displays with the <a href="hints/layouts.html">Layout
        editor</a> you can easily setup your own custom displays with some <a href="hints/userjs.html">Java
        Script</a>.</p>
    <p>You can also include the display of other web pages (external ones or
      pages you created within AvNav). This will be handled as "<a href="userdoc/addonconfigpage.html">User
        Apps</a>".</p>
    <p>The symbols that are used for various displays can be customized with a <a
        href="hints/usericons.html">json file</a> - like the&nbsp; <a href="hints/keyboard.html">keybord
        short cuts</a>.</p>
    <p>With Python, Java Script and CSS you can write <a href="hints/plugins.html">plugins</a>.</p>
