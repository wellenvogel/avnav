    <h1>AvNav Quickstart</h1>
    <p class="western">Important Hint: <i><b>In no case I can promise or being
          reliable for a correct function of AvNav - especially using it for
          navigation is at your own risk. Before using it I recommend to
          carefully test the precision of the display and the used charts.</b></i>Ein

    <div class="toc"></div>
    <p class="western">A detailed description of the concepts and the motivation
      can be found in the chapter <a href="beschreibung.html">introduction</a>.</p>
    <h2 class="western">General</h2>
    <p>AvNav has been designed to be usable on touch devices (also with
      relatively small screens). The idea was to allow easy usage also under "on
      board" conditions.</p>
    <p>You can handle AvNav also with mouse and keyboard, of course.</p>
    <h2 class="western">Installation and Set Up</h2>
    <p>AvNav is available in 2 variants:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Client-Server<br>
        The server will be installed onto a Linux or Windows system (like a
        Raspberry Pi). As "client" you will use an arbitrary browser to interact
        with the system (e.g. on a tablet or smart phone)</li>
      <li>Android App<br>
        The complete functionality is bundled within the app. Additional devices
        can connect with a browser.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Client Server</h3>
    <p>AvNav is available as&nbsp; <a href="install.html#Packages">package for
        various Linux distributions</a> (Debian packages, Rpm) and as a <a href="install.html#Windows">Windows
        installer</a>.<br>
      The debian packages are hosted within a <a href="https://github.com/free-x/avnav/wiki">repository</a>
      und can be downloaded from the <a href="release.html">release page</a>.<br>
      Additionally we maintain <a href="install.html#Headless">images for the
        Raspberry Pi</a>. There is a detailed documentation available in the
      chapter <a href="install.html">installation</a>.</p>
    <p>After installing and starting up you can use your browser to connect to
      AvNav and you will get the <a href="userdoc/index.html">WebApp</a>.<br>
      If you are using our images the raspberry will create a Wifi network with
      an SSID of avnav..., passwors: avnav-secret. If you will connect to this
      network you can reach AvNav with the url http://avnav.avnav.de.<br>
      If you are connected to the server in a different way you can use
      http://avnav.local:8080 (does not work on android) - or you can use the IP
      of the server.<br>
      For IOS and Android devices I would recommend using a Bonjour Browser (no
      need to enter names or IPs).</p>
    <ul>
      <li>IOS: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bonjour-search-for-http-web-in-wi-fi/id1097517829?mt=8"><img
            class="inlineimage" src="https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple69/v4/ba/f9/c2/baf9c2dd-656d-c303-fae1-a07310825e72/pr_source.png/246x0w.png"></a></li>
      <li>Android: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.wellenvogel.bonjourbrowser"><img
            src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sOV0YDqS3VNhTd4PfLB4PKj89_bbP8MtFHCVydjSp1-zLMyc8LB_z_HFVsZQEFgINQ=s180-rw"
            alt="" class="inlineimage"></a> </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Android App</h3>
    <p>The <a href="android.html">App</a> is available in the Play Store <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.wellenvogel.avnav.main"><img
          src="sailboat512r.png" alt="" class="inlineimage"> </a></p>
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>After installing AvNav (or when using a ready to go image) you can start
      normally without any additional configuration. AvNav will scan connected
      USB devices for serial adapters and will try to determine the necessary
      baud rate. Depending on the kind of installation a Udp receiver on port
      34667 is active.</p>
    <p>To adapt AvNav to your particular needs you can edit the config file <a
        href="hints/configfile.html">avnav_server.xml</a>. Additionally you can
      adapt the look and feel with <a href="userdoc/settingspage.html">settings</a>,
      <a href="hints/layouts.html">layout adaptation</a> and with <a href="hints/userjs.html">user
        defined code</a>/<a href="hints/usercss.html">CSS</a> and <a href="hints/plugins.html">plugins</a>.</p>
    <p>At Android all settings are directly integrated in the App (no
      avnav_server.xml).</p>
    <h2>NMEA Data</h2>
    <h3>Client Server</h3>
    <p>AvNav is mainly handling NMEA0183 Data, from connected USB devices,
      serial ports, bluetooth devices,&nbsp; TCP (client and server) or UDP. A
      NMEA multiplexer is integrated that allows for flexible <a href="hints/configfile.html">configuration</a>
      for the flow of received and send data.</p>
    <p>A couple of NMEA sentences is decoded within AvNav (position daten,
      AIS,...) and used for it's display and routing functions.</p>
    <p>In cooperation with <a href="hints/CanboatAndSignalk.html">Canboat and
        SignalK</a> you can also handle <a href="hints/CanboatAndSignalk.html">NMEA2000</a>
      data. Additionally you can use all data from SignalK for the own ship to
      display them within AvNav.</p>
    <h3>Android</h3>
    <p>At <a href="android.html">Android</a> you can utilize the internal GPS.
      Additionally you can have a TCP or bluetooth connection for receiving GPS
      or AIS data. If your devices has USB-OTG available you can also connect an
      USB-serial adapter.</p>
    <h2>Charts</h2>
    <p>AvNav is handling <a href="charts.html#Intro">raster charts</a>. You can
      download them from various sources in the net (e.g. <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/DE:Locus#https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/DE:Locus#Offline-Karten">OpenSeaMap</a>
      or <a href="https://tileservice.charts.noaa.gov/tileset.html#50000_1-locator">NOAA</a>)
      - or you can use software like <a href="https://mobac.sourceforge.io/">MobileAtlasCreator</a>&nbsp;
      or <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/SAS_Planet">SASPlanet</a>
      to download/create charts.</p>
    <p>AvNav can directly handle charts in <a href="charts.html#chartformats">gemf
        and mbtiles formats</a>. Additionally you can <a href="charts.html#Convert">convert</a>
      other types of raster charts like BSB (kap). This can be done directly on
      the server (raspberry) - or better beforehand on a desktop system.</p>
    <p>Additionally AvNav can handle oesenc charts from <a href="hints/ocharts.html">o-charts</a>
      (not on Android). The company is offering charts for Open Source Software
      at reasonable prices.</p>
    <p>Charts have to be uploaded to AvNav before being usable - at the&nbsp; <a
        href="userdoc/downloadpage.html">Files/Download page</a>, section charts
      <img src="viewerimages/icons-new/map2.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">.
      o-chartshave to be uploaded via the <a href="hints/ocharts.html">o-charts
        plugin</a>.</p>
    <p>More details in the chapter <a href="charts.html">charts</a>.</p>
    <h2>Displays</h2>
    <p>At the <a href="userdoc/navpage.html">Navigation page</a> on top of the
      map there will be displays for the boat position, ist course, the route to
      the next waypoint, the current route , AIS targets and their courses,
      navigation circels and defined <a href="hints/overlays.html">overlays</a>.</p>
    <p>At the <a href="userdoc/navpage.html">Navigation page</a>, inside the <a
        href="userdoc/editroutepage.html">Route Editor</a> and at up to 5 <a href="userdoc/dashboardpage.html">Dashboard
        pages</a> you can display the values of all available navigational data.
      This includes the values from <a href="hints/CanboatAndSignalk.html">SignalK</a>.</p>
    <p>You can use simple numeric displays,<a href="hints/layouts.html#gauges">analog
        gauges</a> or graphical displays.</p>
    <p>The displays can be adapted to your preferences. There is a <a href="hints/layouts.html">Layout
        Editor</a> and you can create / adapt displays with some lines of <a href="hints/userjs.html">Java
        Script Code</a> and <a href="hints/usercss.html">CSS</a>.</p>
    <p>You can define different sets of displays and store the on the AvNav
      server. For each display device you can select the set ("layout") that you
      would like to use.</p>
    <p>There is also an adaptation to different screen sizes being available in
      the layout ("small").</p>
    <h2>Routes</h2>
    <p>You can easily create and edit routes within AvNav. You will utilize the
      chart view at the <a href="userdoc/editroutepage.html">Route Editor</a>.
      Normally you just move the center of the chart (cross) to the next point
      you would like to add and with a button click you add this to the route.
      You can easily move, edit or delete points within the route.</p>
    <p>Waypoints or other routes that are shown as <a href="hints/overlays.html">overlays</a>
      can be added to the route.</p>
    <p>You can invert the route or empty it. Within AvNav routes are stored as
      gpx files. You can export or import them at the <a href="userdoc/downloadpage.html">Files/Download
        page</a>. From within the Route Editor you can start the route
      navigation immediately. Within a route there will be an alarming if you
      reach the next waypoint (if you are within an "approach" distance) and
      AvNav will automatically switch to the next waypoint.</p>
    <h2><a name="tracks"></a>Tracks</h2>
    <p>AvNav is constantly writing the current track and showing this on the
      chart. It tries to minimize the points zeichnet beständig den aktuellen
      Track auf. Dabei wird versucht, die Zahl der Trackpunkte zu begrenzen,
      indem nur bei größeren Änderungen oder nach einer bestimmten Zeit erneut
      ein Trackpunkt geschrieben wird (see <a href="hints/configfile.html?lang=en#h3:AVNTrackWriter">Konfiguration
        ANVTrackWriter </a>). The tracks will be written as gpx file at regular
      intervals and can be exported an imported at the <a href="userdoc/downloadpage.html#tracks">Files/Download
        page</a> (you can also show their data like length and time at this
      page). Every day a separate gpx file is created. Available tracks can be
      shown as <a href="hints/overlays.html">overlay</a> on the chart.</p>
    <p>You can&nbsp; <a href="hints/TracksToRoutes.html">convert a track into a
        route</a>. There is some logic available to reduce the number of points.</p>
    <h2>AIS</h2>
    <p>On your chart there will be a display of the AIS targets within a defined
      range (default: 20nm) with their positions and courses. There si a
      computation of the next target with a warning if a defined minimal
      distance is not met.</p>
    <p>The symbols for the AIS targets can be replaced by <a href="hints/usericons.html">own
        symbols</a> - optionally different ones depending on the AIS shiptype.
      For the own boat and for each AIS target a course vector is drawn that
      will point to the position you will reach after a defined time interval
      (default: 10 minutes).</p>
    <p>By clicking an AIS target (or the "next AIS" display) you will get all <a
        href="userdoc/aisinfopage.html">information</a> for this target and you
      can change to the <a href="userdoc/aispage.html">list of all AIS targets</a>.</p>
    <h2>Alarm</h2>
    <p>AvNav create alarms for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Anchor Watch<br>
        On the <a href="userdoc/dashboardpage.html#anchorwatch">Dashboard pages</a>
        you can activate the anchor watch. Depending on the layout the displays
        will be adapted. If your boat leaves the defined circle or if the gps
        signal is lost an alarm will be created.</li>
      <li>Approaching the next waypoint</li>
      <li>Man over Board<br>
        On all pages there is a separate <img src="viewerimages/icons-new/drowning.svg"
          alt="" class="inlineimage"> <a href="userdoc/mainpage.html#mob">Man-over-board
          button</a>. By clicking this button the current position will become
        the routing target, all other routings will be stopped. Additionally the
        alarm is being created.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All alarms will be handled on the AvNav server. This way you can switch
      of all display devices but any alarm handling (like e.g. anchor watch)
      will continue to work.</p>
    <p>You can create a sound (both at the server and at display devices) for
      the alarm. At the server you can trigger arbitrary commands whenever an
      alarm occurs (see <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav/tree/master/hardware/simple-pi">example</a>)
      . The configuration is handled within the <a href="hints/configfile.html#h3:AVNAlarmHandler">configfile
        - AVNAlarmHandler</a>.</p>
    <h2>Nightmode</h2>
    <p>At the <a href="userdoc/mainpage.html">Main page</a> you can active the
      night mode <img src="viewerimages/icons-new/night.svg" alt="" class="inlineimage">.
      All displays will be adapted.</p>
    <h2>Adaptations</h2>
    <p>You can adapt AvNav to your personal needs with various technologies. As
      all the display is handled within a browser you can use <a href="hints/usercss.html">CSS</a>
      to customize your display.</p>
    <p>The server configuration is done with the file <a href="hints/configfile.html">avnav_server.xml</a>.</p>
    <p>Beside adapting the displays within the <a href="hints/layouts.html">Layout
        editor</a> you can easily create your own displays with some <a href="hints/userjs.html">Java
        Script</a>.</p>
    <p>You can also include the display of other web pages (external ones or
      pages you created within AvNav). This will be handled as "<a href="userdoc/addonconfigpage.html">User
        Apps</a>".</p>
    <p>The symbols that are used for various displays can be changed with a <a
        href="hints/usericons.html">json file</a> - like the&nbsp; <a href="hints/keyboard.html">keybord
        short cuts</a>.</p>
    <p>With Python, Java Script and CSS you can write <a href="hints/plugins.html">plugins</a>.</p>
