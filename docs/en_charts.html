    <p>To use charts in AvNav they have to be available in a tile format. This
      is a format used by services like OpenStreetMaps or GoogleMaps. A tile has
      (normally) a size of 256x256 pixel. The world will be projected to a flat
      surface (like a paper cylinder wrapped around the earth at the aequator).
      Each point with it's coordinates (longitued/latitude) will pe projected at
      this cylinder. How this is done exactly, which units will be used and if
      you consider the earth to be a ellipsoid or a sphere is described by the
      projection. AvNav is using the so called google mercator projection (earth
      considered a sphere) with the EPSG code 900913. The projected units are
      always meters (but can be converted to longitude and latitude). If you
      have charts using a different projection they have to be reprojected
      before.</p>
    <p>The whole projection area is split into tiles. The zoom level provides
      the number of tiles for the complete area. Zoom level 0 means: The
      complete earth (from -85°...+85°, outside the projection is undefined) is
      shown in one tile of 256x256 pixel. With every other level there will be
      more tiles - level 1: 2x2 tiles, level 2: 4x4 tiles. The most relevant
      zoom levels for our usage typically range from 7 till 18..19. That means
      at level 19:2^19x2^19 tiles.<br>
      For display the library <a href="http://www.openlayers.org/">openlayers</a>
      is used. This library loads the tiles based on the zoom level from the
      server (raspberry) and displays them on the screen. This library is often
      used in OpenStreatMap applications.<br>
      You can easily imagine that there will be huge numbers of tiles for higher
      zoom level (if you try e.g. zoom 19 for all). Therefor it makes sense to
      follow the same approach we have for paper charts: For overview a small
      zoom level, detail charts a bit more and e.g. port approaches with the
      highest levels 18 or 19 (60cm/pixel and 30cm/pixel). To still get a nice
      display experience the different detail levels can be put one on top of
      the other in layers. If there is a better (higher) zoomlevel for an area
      this one will be displayed - otherwise the one with a lower zoom level
      (potentially up scaled). To not overload our display devices the number of
      layers should be limited to 3...5 (depending on the device). </p>
    <p>For converting chart the task is to sort available charts into such
      layers, to potentially reporoject them and afterwards create the chart
      tiles (maybe together with a description). Typically this requires a lot
      of computing power (and time) and should be better run on a desktop
      system. But typically this should be no problem as you will do this only
      once. Finally you will get a continous displaywithout any breaks in
      between.<br>
      For downloading charts you have to consider this, too. You need to select
      the areas an zoom levels carefully. </p>
    <p>How you do this depends on the source. I currently have suppor for 2
      options to create charts for AvNav:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Converting charts using <a href="http://www.gdal.org/">GDAL</a>
          (like BSB) – you can use everything that GDAL can read</p>
      </li>
      <li> Downloading charts using the <a href="http://mobac.sourceforge.net/">Mobile
          Atlas Creator</a>. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="chartformats" id="chartformats"></a>Chart Formats</h2>
    <p>AvNav uses <a href="http://www.cgtk.co.uk/gemf">GEMF</a> as its primary
      format. It is a compact binary format that collects all the tiles into one
      file together with the necessary meta data. With this format some special
      function like automatic zoom level adaptation are possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      Since version 20200325 AvNav can directly use the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/MBTiles">mbtiles</a>
      format. For this format you potentially have to select the correct format
      for the internal sorting of the tiles. The default formt is "xyz" but
      there is also a "tms" format available. You can switch the format at the <a
        href="userdoc/downloadpage.html#mbtiles">Files/Download</a> page.
      MbTiles you can directly download e.g. from <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/DE:Locus#https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/DE:Locus#Offline-Karten">OpenSeamap</a>.<br>
      Additionally (since 20200325) you can also use online chart sources if
      they support the default url format. You have to configure this with an
      xml file. An example can be found in the provided <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav/blob/master/viewer/demo/osm-online.xml">online
        source for OpenSeaMap</a>.</p>
    <p>Since Version 20200515 you can use a <a href="hints/ocharts.html">plugin</a>
      to also utilize charts from <a href="https://o-charts.org/">o-charts</a>.</p>
    <h2><a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation of Charts</h2>
    <p>Afgter installing AvNav there is only one/a couple of online demo charts
      available. For real usage you have to install charts in AvNav.<br>
      You can do this either by directly copying charts into the chart directory
      (/home/pi/avnav/data/charts) or the external chart directory on android.
      But you can also upload the charts directly within the WebApp (some only
      starting from 20200325).The upload can be done on the <a href="userdoc/downloadpage.html#chartupload">Files/Download
        page</a>.<br>
      For android you have to consider that mbtiles can only be handled after
      uploading them - not from the external chart directory.<br>
      For mbtiles consider the option for switching the internal scheme <a href="userdoc/downloadpage.html#mbtiles">at
        the Files/Download page</a> .</p>
    <p>In normal versions (not android) starting from 20200325 you can also
      upload charts that still need a conversion. The converter decsribed
      at&nbsp; <a href="#Convert">Converting</a> is always&nbsp; part of AvNav.
      It will read files from it's import directory (/home/pi/avnav/data/import)
      or from sub directories. If you select a file for <a href="userdoc/downloadpage.html#chartupload">Upload</a>
      with a name that will be handled by the converter (like .kap) you will be
      asked if you want this file to be put into the converter import directory.
      You can watch the working state of the importer at the <a href="userdoc/statuspage.html">status
        page</a>. You should keep in mind that converting is consuming a lot of
      CPU and can last for hours on the raspberry pi. Potentially it is more
      efficient to run this on a desktop system.<br>
    </p>
    <h2 class="western"><a id="Convert" name="Convert"></a>Converting Charts</h2>
    <p>As described you can run the conversion directly on the pi - but it will
      take time.</p>
    <p>It is potentially more appropriate to run the conversion on a desktop
      computer. You can do this on Linux or Windows. For the necessary
      installtions see:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="install.html#Packages">Linux</a></li>
      <li><a href="install.html#Windows">Windows</a></li>
    </ul>
    The central part of the conversion will be handled by tile tools (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/tilers-tools/">https://code.google.com/p/tilers-tools/</a>)
    - a copy is included in AvNav.<br>
    On a desktop the charts will be created at
    &lt;UserHome&gt;/AvNavCharts/out&nbsp; (e.g.
    c:\Users\Andreas\AvNavCharts\out). In the UI you can select the output path.
    For each run normally one gemf file is created. The name is derived from the
    first selected input file or directory.<br>
    There will be a work directory below AvNavCharts - you should not delete
    this as it would speed up a second conversion run (if you e.g. got some
    corrected input charts).<br>
    The conversion consists of the steps:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>sorting the charts into layers (and potentially converting them)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>creation of the tiles</p>
      </li>
      <li>creation of the gemf file</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After creation of the gemf file just <a href="#installation">install</a>
      it on the pi.<br>
      You can also test the created chart directly on your desktop. The
      converter will bring up the AvNav server and you can connect with a
      browser.</p>
    <h4><a name="windows" id="windows"></a>Windows</h4>
    <p>The <a href="install.html#Windows">Net-Installer</a> (AvNavNet...) for
      windows will install all the necessary software:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>python 2.7.10 (32 Bit)</li>
      <li>GDAL 1.11 for python 2.7 (32 Bit)</li>
      <li>Pillow 2.7.0</li>
      <li>pyserial 2.7</li>
    </ul>
    The installer will be installed at ProgramFiles\AvNav. If you deinstall
    AvNav only the installer will be removed.<br>
    All the downloaded software will be installed at the user home diectory and
    have to be removed from the UI.<br>
    After installation you can start with AvChartConvert. <br>
    <br>
    There is only one screen:<br>
    <br>
    <img alt="windows gui" src="avnav-windows-new.png" width="800px"><br>
    <p>At (1) you can select the files/directories you would like to convert. At
      (2) the conversion process will start. A logfile will be written that can
      be shown using the "view" button. If something goes wrong I need this log
      in any case.<br>
      With default settings after the conversion has finished the AvNav server
      will start up and a browser will be brought up that is connected.<br>
      If the necessary software has not been installed yet a dialog is brought
      up that asks you if it should be installed right now. At (5) you can
      repeat this step for an update. At (4) you can remove the downloaded
      software.<br>
      In the software some demo NMEA data is included (southern baltic,
      Greifswalder Bodden), You can also use any other NMEA0183 file as an
      input.<br>
      As the server is a full featured AvNav you can also read NMEA data from a
      connected device or from bluetooth or IP. If you have special needs you
      can create your own avnav_server.xml and set up things there.</p>
    <p>This way it is also possible to use AvNav e.g. on a laptop on board. <br>
      If you only want to start up the server - use (3) "startServer". Has to be
      repeated after every configuration change.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Linux</h4>
    As described at <a href="install.html#Packages">Installation</a> start up
    AvNav using avnav -g and select the charts you would like to convert.<br>
    <h4>Details</h4>
    Here are some details about the conversion steps. Normally you do not take
    care about them. You only need them if some of the default settings do not
    fit your needs.
    <blockquote>
      <div style="font-size:small">
        <p>The first step is fast. All chart data will be read and resolution
          and range will be detected. If necessary charts would be
          converted/reprojected. As a result there will be a chartlist.xml at
          workdir/&lt;name&gt; . The command line would be:</p>
        <pre>read_charts.py -o name -m chartlist inputdir [inputdir...]
</pre>
        <p>Afterwards you can check the chartlist.xml and you could e.g. move
          some charts into a different layer.</p>
        <p>The second step will take more time - it is the creation of the
          tiles:</p>
        <pre>read_charts.py -o name -m generate 
</pre>
        <p>The file chartlist.xml must already exist at&nbsp;
          workdir/&lt;name&gt;. The creation will run multi threaded.</p>
        <p>You could also combine both steps:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>read_charts.py -m all [-o name] inputdir
</pre> </blockquote>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <h3 class="western"><a id="Download" name="Download"></a>Download using
      Mobile Atlas Creator</h3>
    <p>For using the <a href="https://mobac.sourceforge.io/">Mobile Atlas
        Creators</a> you only Java and the MOBAC itself. It is important to
      follow a certain schem when selecting the ranges for download to make the
      charts fit onto the described layer concept and you limit the amount of
      data. </p>
    <p>I recommend to typically use 3 layers: overview( zoom level 7-10),
      navigation (level 10-15), details (Level 16-18). Afterwards just work in
      MOBAC layer by layer. Select the zoom levels for the layer, select the
      areas you want and add them with an arbitrary name. Repeat this for all
      layers. Now save your selection using a meaningfull name (the xml file
      could be reused later). Select OsmDroid GEMF (File-&gt;convertAtlasFormat)
      as output format and start the atlas creation. In the output directory a
      xxx.gemf file will be created. <a href="#installation">Install</a> this
      on the pi. Datei.<br>
