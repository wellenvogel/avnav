 Example 1:
 register an own simple display just being able to display
 a value using the default widget.
 So there is no need to write any display code. But we will add a formatter,
 that will convert Hz into rpm.
 We are going to display a rpm value - and expect the input to be in Hz
 The formatter will get the current value as first parameter
 we also allow a second parameter (can be set in the layout editor at formatterParameters),
 if this is set to something not empty we will just return the input value
