     debugToLog controls whether any debug output will also go to the logfile
     you can change the loglevel by an HTTP request to the navurl:
     http://somehost:8080/viewer/avnav_navi.php?request=debuglevel&level=DEBUG
     maxtimeback: maximal time in seconds that we allow the system clock to go back before we delete all data
     settimecmd: command to set the systemtime (must accept time in format like date - utc - and must be able to run as pi)
     systimediff: timediff in seconds between gps timestamp and system time that we allow before we set gps time
     settimeperiod: time in seconds befor we retry setting the systemtime
     ownMMSI: Own ship's MMSI

<!-- udev based detection of serial devices
	 we can have an autodetection here but can also add defined devices
	 to e.g. limit to some USB ports (or later for output)
	 identification of devices is based on the USB bus id
	 this heavily depends on the topology of the connected devices
	 for my setup with an USB 4 port HUB at the upper USB port
	 a device at the hubs first port will look like: 1-1.2.1:1.0 ,
	 at the second 1-1.2.2:1.0 - potentially you must check the logs
	 The below config uses a predefined device with this ID and 
	 room for 4 additional autodetect devices
	 The serial parameters are the same like for all serial readers
	 We use autobaud between 4800 and 38400 here
	 The data is feed through the gpsd feeder

      we have autobauding from 4800 to 38400 baud

      This stuff is "legacy" on systems that have udev support
      because for them we use the AVNUsbSerialReader
      But if we need to interface to some none usb-serial interfaces or run on a system without udev
      those configurations can be used
      Devices like /dev/rfcommn can be used for bluetooth connections setup outside of us...

<!-- the following entries provide the integration with signalk and canboat
     we provide a connector to canboat (n2kd) to receive all data that has been translated from nmea2000 to nmea0183
       for the socketreader that connects to 2599 we set a very long timeout (one year) as
       n2k does not really handle its sockets correctly and leaves them in CLOSE_WAIT.
       So after ~1000 connect retries if there is no data on the bus(~3h with the default 10s) n2kd becomes unusable as
       it is out of open file descriptors. It will consume 100% CPU at this time.
     we provide an additional socket that will provide only the nmea data that has not been received from canboat
       this will be used for signalk to get all of our nmea0183. signalk will itself connect to canboat to get the nmea2000
       directly, inside signalk just configure a connector to this port and the canboat nmea200 connector
     we additional have 2 plugins:
       * signalk: will receive all data at vessels/self from signalk and store it at gps.signalk in our store
       * canboat: will receive pgns that are not translated to NMEA0183 - currently only 126992 to get the time
     for canboat to work you potentially need to modify /etc/default/n2kd and /boot/config.txt
